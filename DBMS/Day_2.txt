when you retrieve the data what will be the default order of the data? - no order

To sort the data - use order by clause

order by clause sorts the data in ascending order
numbers : lowest to highest
Alphabets : a..z (alphabetical order)
Dates : oldest to latest
Nulls : ?


To sort the data in descending order use desc clause in the order by

fetch the last_name, salary and commission_pct. sort the data in the increasing order of commission_pct

select last_name, salary,commission_pct
from employees
order by commission_pct

select last_name, salary,commission_pct
from employees
order by commission_pct asc

Position of the column as it appears in the select statement can be specified in the order by clause for sorting:

select last_name, salary,commission_pct
from employees
order by 3

if a column contains null : 
ASC : null records will be placed at the last
DESC : null records will be placed on top

within these null records the data will be unordered

% -> any chatecter can occour any no of times (0 or more occourrence of any charecter)
_ -> one occurrence of any charetcer

1.
Fetch the last_name, salary and commission amount of employees who are 	
	1.eligible for commission
	2. get commission amount > 1500
sort the data in the increasing order of commission amount

select last_name, salary, salary*commission_pct as "comm amt"
from employees
where commission_pct is not null AND
(salary*comission_pct) > 1500
order by 3;

2. 
 There is an opening for a role in the organization with a salary budget between 5000 and 10000. The HR of the organization would want to find out the job title of the designation which falls within this range

select job_title from jobs
where min_salary >=5000 and max_salary<=10000




Which of the below queries are correct, if incorrect, correct the errors
a.	

error

Select last_name, first_name, salary, salary*12 as "Annual Salary"
From employees
Where "Annual Salary" > 25000
Order by 2 desc, "Annual Salary" asc

No error
Select last_name, first_name, salary, salary*12 as "Annual Salary"
From employees
Where (salary*12) > 25000
Order by 2 desc, "Annual Salary" asc

First_name  Annual salary
Usman	    5000
zaman	    4000
Zaman	    6000
Amar	    9000
Amar	    15000




b.

No error
Select last_name
From employees
Order by salary


column aliases can be used in the order by clause
column on which you sort need not be present in the select clause




I want to retrieve last_name and salary for any value of salary which is input by the user

select last_name, salary
from employees
where salary > ???

This is achieved by using substitution variables. These are dummy variables whose scope is only within the query, these variables are prefixed with an &

select last_name, salary
from employees
where salary > &sal

here &sal is a substitution variable, the value for which will be taken at run time from the user

Another example: for substituting charetcer data, place the substitution variables within single quotes

select last_name, salary
from employees
where last_name = '&lname'







Suppose i want to execute some queries for the same value of salary, and i am lazy to enter the value of salary every time

select last_name, first_name
from employees
where salary > &sal


select last_name, first_name
from employees
where salary < &sal


select last_name, department_id
from employees
where salary > &sal


select last_name, department_id, commission_pct
from employees
where salary > &sal


All of these queries are to be executed for some value of salary input by the user

use define clause to set the substitution variable globally. scope of these variable would be in the entire session

define sal=5000;

to clear the value of the substitution variable use undefine
undefine sal;



Find the Number of weeks an employee has worked in a job role. 

select (end_date-start_date)/7 as week
from job_history


valid operations on dates:
date1-date2 : number of days between 2 dates
date1+10 : date after 10 days
date1-10 : date before 10 days



Q. Find out how many days have been lapsed since hiring of all employees in dept 90.

select sysdate-hire_date as "days lapsed"
from employees
where department_id = 90;



select '10'+'10' from dual; --20

select 10||'hi' from dual; --10hi

select 10 +'hi' from dual; --error





Groping data and Aggregates
Aggregate functions in SQL:

count(col) -> count of all non-null records in the column
count(*) -> counts the rows in the table
min
max
avg


Group 



how many employees do i have in every department




select department_id, count(*), sum(salary), max(salary), avg(salary)
from employees
group by department_id


while grouping the data you can select:
1. the column on which you are grouping
2. any aggregate you want to appply for every grouped column


below query does not make any sense and it will result in an error
select department_id, last_name,count(*)
from employees
group by department_id


After grouping the data you can only restrict the groups and sort them and not the original rows. hence below query will result in an error

SELECT   department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM     employees
GROUP BY department_id
order by salary


what happens?
SELECT   department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM     employees
GROUP BY department_id
order by count(*)
