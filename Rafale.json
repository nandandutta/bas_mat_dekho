{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b5a"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale news","text":"The Indian Air Force (IAF) has much to cheer with the arrival of five Rafale omni-role fighter jets in terms of the technology and capability accretion that it brings. In the words of the Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria and former ACM B.S. Dhanoa, Rafale is a “game changer”.\n\nEncapsulating what the Rafales bring in, ACM Bhadauria said in February that at the time of the Kargil conflict in 1999, India had an edge over Pakistan in terms of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile capability. “We allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade-and-a-half of struggle in the acquisition process to be able to get better capability,” he said. The Rafale, armed with the Meteor BVR air-to-air missile, will restore that edge in the neighbourhood as there is no equivalent to it currently.\n\nAccording to its manufacturer Dassault Aviation, Rafale is an omni-role fighter capable of the entire spectrum of roles — air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. With its advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, electronic warfare suite and network-centric capabilities in addition to its armaments, Rafale is now the most advanced fighter in the IAF arsenal, overtaking the SU-30MKI, which is due for major upgrades.\n\nRafale is also the first imported fighter to join service in over two decades since the SU-30s in the late 1990s. Rafale has 14 hard points for weapons and can carry a total external load of over 9 tonnes. In addition to the Meteor, it is armed with SCALP long-range stand-off attack air-to-ground missiles and MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles. The latest addition, HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) medium range air-to-ground missiles, is being procured through the emergency route.\n\nAnother significant factor with the Rafales is that as per contract, at least 75% of the Rafale fleet has to be operationally available, which would make it the most available fighter in the IAF fleet. The first Rafale squadron, No. 17 Golden Arrows, will be based at Ambala and the second squadron will be at Hasimara. All 36 aircraft will be delivered on schedule by end 2021, the Indian Embassy in France said last week.\n\nThe €7.87 billion (₹59,262 crore) inter-governmental agreement, signed in September 2016 between India and France for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition, also includes 13 India-Specific Enhancements (ISE), the non-recurring design and development cost of which is ₹9,855 crore. Some of them pertain to radar enhancements, helmet mounted display, ability to start and operate from high altitude airfields, advanced infrared search and track sensor and a very potent electronic jammer pod.\n\nThe deal also epitomises the cumbersome defence procurement process in which government-to-government deals have of late become the way out. Rafale was originally selected under the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft tender issued in 2007, which itself was conceived as a Mig-21 replacement project in early 2000s. Rafale was selected in 2012 but negotiations got stuck due to differences and the tender was eventually withdrawn after the emergency purchase announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April 2015, citing “critical operational necessity” of the IAF.\n\nFalling numbers\n\nHowever, the 36 Rafales will do little to arrest the falling numbers of fighter squadrons of the IAF, which has a sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons but is down to 31 at present. To offset that, the IAF is banking on the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). A contract for 83 LCA-Mk1A is in final stages and they are in addition to the 40 jets already contracted for. A more advanced LCA-Mk2 is also in the works. The government has recently approved the procurement of 21 MIG-29 jets from Russia, which will add two additional squadrons. In addition, 12 SU-30MKI aircraft have also been approved, which will replenish the numbers of Sukhois lost in crashes. The IAF will also phase out five squadrons of Mig-21s in the the next few years.\n\nWhile the IAF works to keep the numbers from falling further, the Rafale, which joins the IAF at a time of unprecedented tensions on the border with China, will give a qualitative edge to the force in the region.","title":"Rafale jets | The ‘game-changer’ fighters","author":["Law In Question Is Unconstitutional","Rooted In Colonialism","They Say","In The Past Months","They Were Done Primarily Through Embassies"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-jets-the-game-changer-fighters/article32249724.ece","image":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l9uzfv/article32249721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-RAFALE-1"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b5f"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale news","text":"Controversy originating from the Indian MRCA competition\n\nA Dassault Rafale flying at Aero India 2017\n\nThe Rafale deal controversy is a political controversy in India related to the purchase of 36 multirole fighter aircraft for a price estimated at €.8 billion by the Defence Ministry of India from France's Dassault Aviation. The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nThe final legal judgement on the controversy was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2019. It dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.[1] The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.[2][3] In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crore).[4] In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints.[5] In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture.[6] After the Indian general election in April–May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress.\n\nAs disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale.[7][8][9] Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable.[10] In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid.[11] On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO Éric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \"95 percent completed\".[12]\n\nDuring an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \"critical operational necessity\".[13] In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun.[14] In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition.[15] In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of €7.87 billion (₹58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to €11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and €8.6 billion quoted in January 2016.[16] Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%.[17]\n\nIn September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.[16] According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package.[18] It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of €91.1 million (₹681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of €94 million (₹703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of €1.8 billion (₹13,470 crore), a weapons package costing €710 million (₹5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of €353 million (₹2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground cruise missile.[19] The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers.[20]\n\nThe agreement included a 50% \"offset clause\", which required the companies involved in the agreement—primarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA—to invest 50% of the contract value (approximately €3.9 billion or ₹30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately €1.2 billion or ₹9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).[18][21] Of this 50%, 74% (approximately €2.9 billion or ₹22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers.[22]\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\" (IDDM) initiative.[23] Dassault intended to invest in excess of €100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations.[24] The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018.[25]. Despite having zero experience in aircraft part production, when Reliance Group was chosen as a partner instead of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, doubts were raised based on closeness of Ambani family with prime minster Narendra Modi[26].\n\nAllegations [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of price escalation [ edit ]\n\nThe day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹715 crore to ₹1,600 crore.[27] A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ₹670 crore.[28][29] In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹526.1 crore to ₹1,570 crore.[30] Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements.[31][32] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender.[33] French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures.[34]\n\nIn an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables.[35]\n\nAllegations of favouritism [ edit ]\n\nModi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones.\n\nIn November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault.[36]\n\nAnil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo-French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%.[30] Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn.[37]\n\nDefence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies.[31] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO.[38] French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total.[34]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nWhile campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack prime minister Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited.[39][40] Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder.[41]\n\nIn December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force.[42][43]\n\n2018 budget session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA.[44] Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam.[45] Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered.[46] In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012.[47][48] Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total.[49] Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals.[50] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public.[51] Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation.[52]\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken.[53]\n\nIndia Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to €99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was €91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements.[54][55] The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ₹525 crore or €79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to €100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as €91.7 million for each aircraft, €1.8 billion for spare parts, €1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, €710 million for weapons and €353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%.[56]\n\nIn an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind.[57][58] A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018.[59]\n\nCongress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ₹1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ₹1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ₹351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security.[60] Dassault's CEO, Éric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals.[61] On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ₹670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\".[28][62]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government.[63] In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ₹45,000 crore was stolen and given to \"an industrialist friend\", referring to Anil Ambani.[64] In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ₹700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \"his friend's company\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited.[65] In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition.[66]\n\n2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ₹45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement.[67][68] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim.[69][70] Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments.[71] Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information.[72]\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was €79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to €100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the €91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper.[73] He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds.[74]\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016.[75] He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth ₹30,000 crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at ₹100,000 crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of ₹130,000 crore and termed it as a theft.[76][77] Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal.[78]\n\nRajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get ₹30,000 crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture—Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited—had 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived.[79]\n\nArun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of ₹1,000 crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations.[80][81] They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so.[82] The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision.[83]\n\nIn response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \"fully loaded\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year.[84][85] M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op-ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of ₹45,000 crore in a contract worth ₹58,000 crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at ₹538 crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to ₹737 crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of ₹670 crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to ₹2,023 crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth ₹30,000 crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of ₹45,000 crore from offsets.[86]\n\nAir Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale\n\nVice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy.[87] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts.[88] Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft.[89] Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal.[90]\n\nNirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational.[91] T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government.[92] Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying.[93] Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft.[94][95]\n\nCongress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal.[96] They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal.[97] Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee.[98] Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.[99] Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \"political witch hunt\".[100] Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal.[101]\n\nQuoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre-existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015.[102] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get ₹30,000 crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only ₹6,500 crore.[103]\n\nReliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.[104]\n\nFrançois Hollande [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France François Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing.[105] When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact.[106] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \"full freedom\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too.[107][108][109] Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance.[110] Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault.[111][112] Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down.[113]\n\nSupreme Court writ petition [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption.[114] Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court.[115] On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October.[116]\n\nOn 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner.[117][118][120] In its ruling, the court said it has \"studied the material carefully\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing.[118] It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government.[118][121] It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement.[118] \"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime’s) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\".[118] It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package.[118] \"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\" the court said.[118][121]\n\nOn the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material.[118][122] \"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\" the court said.[122] The court said \"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\" adding that the \"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\"[123]\n\nChief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\"[124]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nNotwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\"[125] The Indian government promptly rejected the demand.[126] Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal.[127] Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order.[127] Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report.[127]\n\nThe ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed.[128] Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\".[129]\n\nThe petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\"[130] adding that \"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\".[130] While claiming that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\" the trio accused the court of taking a \"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\"[130][131] The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \"full public disclosure of all the facts\" along with \"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\".[131]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \"sharp attack\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\".[132] The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \"expose\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal.[133][clarification needed]\n\nSamajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \"is supreme in the eyes of people\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\" he said.[134] Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC.[135]\n\nPlea for corrections in verdict [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections.[136] The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\"[137][138] By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain.[137] The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report.[137] The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter.[137][139]\n\nOn 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \"self-contradictory\"[140] and to issue notices to the government for \"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\"[141][139] The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\".[139]\n\nThe Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January,[138] along with a review petition from the petitioners.[138][needs update]\n\nFinal Supreme Court judgement [ edit ]\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict from 14 December 2018 on the controversy. It upheld its the previous judgement stating that no irregularities or corruption were found in the deal.[142][143][144] The judgement has been seen with suspicion by some sections as the Chief Justice of India was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Bharatiya Janata Party government within months after his retirement, which was seen as possible quid-pro-quo for delivering a favourable judgement[145].\n\nSee also [ edit ]","title":"Rafale deal controversy","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Rafale_at_Aero_India_2017.jpg"}

You have to set up a logistics chain, train technical and ground staff in India,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it usually takes up to two years before a new squadron is fully functional. The Rafale squadron will be fully operational when it has at least 18 aircraft.\n\nThe delivery of the remaining Rafale aircraft is expected to be completed by next year.\n\nThe jets, manufactured by French firm Dassault Aviation, took off from France on Monday and landed in the UAE for an overnight stopover. The journey showcased the aircraft's endurance and mid-air fuelling capability.\n\nThe Rafale is a multi-role aircraft, capable of carrying out long-range missions, including highly accurate sea and ground attacks.\n\nAnalysts say the arrival of the jets will boost the morale of the air force, which has been facing a shortage of fighter aircraft.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Rafale jets will boost India's air force fleet\n\nIndia needs 42 squadrons in the scenario of a two-front war with China and Pakistan. But its squadron strength has been depleted to 31, largely because of ageing Russian aircraft.\n\nThe purchase of new fighter jets has been in the making for years. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government began the process in 2000, and its successor, a Congress party-led administration, continued it and issued tenders in 2008 to buy 126 jets.\n\nDassault was finalised as a supplier in 2012, and the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was selected as partner to produce 108 jets in India.\n\nThe deal - from start to finish\n\n2001: India decides to buy 126 fighter jets to strengthen its air force\n\n2007: Tenders are issued\n\n2008: Companies such as America's Boeing, Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, Sweden's Saab and France's Dassault put in bids\n\n2012: Dassault, which submitted the lowest bid, is shortlisted\n\n2014: The deal is put on hold as the BJP's Narendra Modi becomes PM\n\n2015: During his visit to France, Mr Modi announces India's decision to buy 36 \"ready to fly\" Rafale jets\n\n2016: A deal is finalised to buy the 36 jets\n\nBut the deal stalled when the two partners couldn't agree on terms and conditions.\n\nWhen the BJP returned to power under Mr Modi in 2014, he made the procurement of the jets a priority. But rather than taking the deal forward, he surprised many by ordering 36 jets as part of a new deal in which HAL was not included.\n\nThe Indian government says it decided to buy the 36 jets in \"fly-away\" condition to quickly address the problem of the air force's depleting strength.\n\nBut it's not clear where India will procure the remaining aircraft it needs in the long run. The air force announced in 2018 that it would be seeking bids for around 110 more fighter jets, but the deal is yet to be finalised.","title":"Rafale: India gets new jets amid border tension with China","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53573878","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AC61/production/_113692144_iaf.jpg"}

(Image Credit: IAF)\n\nKey Highlights The arrival of the jets was met with great excitement by the Indian Press with numerous outlets lauding the government's conviction in its drive to modernise the country's military Prior to touchdown of the jets, the Express Tribune was not alone in diverting attention from how the jets will enhance the IAF's capabilities toward the supposed “political debate” around the deal The Daily Times' coverage of the event was muted as it instead sought to focus on the comments made Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui\n\nEarlier this week, the Indian Air Force received a huge boost to its capabilities with the arrival of the first batch of French-made Rafale aircraft. The five aircraft made the 7,000km journey from France to the Indian sub-continent before touching down at the IAF's airbase in Ambala.\n\nTheir arrival has been four years in the making with the Narendra Modi-led government inking a Rs 59,000 crore deal with France as far back as 2016 for the procurement of 28 single-seater aircraft, and an additional eight dual-seater jets. The jets that landed in Ambala will become part of the recently revived 'Golden Arrows' squadron with some reports suggesting that they could immediately be stationed near the border in Eastern Ladakh following testing.\n\nWhat the Pak news media reported\n\nThe arrival of the jets was met with great excitement by the Indian Press with numerous outlets lauding the government's conviction in its drive to modernise the country's military. Scores of reports detailing the features of one of the most highly regarded pieces of aviation technology flooded the web to add to the deluge of social media posts from netizens hailing the landmark deal.\n\nUnsurprisingly though, the same could not be said of the Pakistani Press. Reporting of the Rafale aircraft's arrival was scant yet the overarching sentiment appeared to be one of trepidation with worries that the latest acquisitions may, in reality, be deployed by India, not at the Sino-Indian border, but along the Indo-Pak border.\n\nAn op-ed in the Express Tribune read,\n\n“The Indian media has branded the Rafale jets as a game-changer in any future conflict with China. But it is very difficult to comprehend as to how Rafale jets will change the military equation when India is not in a position to use these aircrafts directly agains China in an all-out war. Therefore, some might argue that this massive procurement of military hardware by India is not directed towards China but will instead be utlised against Pakistan.”\n\nPrior to touchdown of the jets, the Express Tribune was not alone in diverting attention from how the jets will enhance the IAF's capabilities toward the supposed “political debate” around the deal.\n\nA report from the publication read, “A multi-billion dollar deal to buy French warplanes had triggered a political debate in the country, with the main opposition Congress Party accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making the purchase at a price three times higher than what had been negotiated in 2014, when the Congress was in power.”\n\nThe Daily Times' coverage of the event was muted as it instead sought to focus on the comments made by Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui.\n\nA report read, “The FO spokesperson said India was continously enhancing its military capability beyond genuine security requirement and asked the world community to “dissuade India from its disproportionate arms build-up.””\n\nDawn had the same idea, highlighting Farooqui's hyberbolic claim that the nature of such deals could trigger an arms race in the region.\n\nHowever, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's inauguration of the first Rafale jet in October 2019 was treated rather amusingly by The Daily Times that published a piece with the following headline - “Indian Defence Minister forcefully converts the French Rafale fighter Jet from Christianity to Hinduism” - as it tried quite creatively to apply a communal bend to what was, largely, a routine puja.\n\n","title":"IAF adds new muscle with Rafale fighters: How Pak media reported the news","author":["Updated Jul"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/iaf-adds-new-muscle-with-rafale-fighters-how-pak-media-reported-the-news/630141","image":"https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/rafale_1_1596035263_rend_4_3.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top"}

It can detect enemies in a range of 120 kms.

An undetectable passive radar sensor which is an extremely precise optical camera. Recognisance pod: a massive digital camera which can take photos at any speed with a precision of 10 cms. And finally, Spectra, an integrated defence aid system which can jam or counter-jam enemy radar signals, give missile-approach warnings and send out decoy signals in case an enemy missile gets too close to the Rafale.\n\nDecoy signal is an electromagnetic pulse sent from the rear of the plane which de-roots enemy missile.\n\nSo, clearly, it's a tough fight between Rafale and F-16.

It can be used to perform ground and sea attacks, reconnaissance, high-accuracy strikes and nuclear strike deterrence.\n\nThe aircraft was developed for the French Navy and French Air Force.\n\nThe fighter aircraft was used in combat operations in various nations, including Afghanistan, Mali, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Egypt, Qatar and India also ordered the aircraft.\n\nRafale combat aircraft was exhibited at Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) Exhibition in March 2019.\n\nFrance’s airforce and navy ordered 180 (132 for the airforce and 48 for the navy) and 152 aircraft were delivered by January 2019. The manufacturer is expected to resume the delivery of the remaining 28 aircraft in 2022.\n\nThe Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and the French Air Force in 2006. Ten aircraft are operational on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier.\n\nThe State of Qatar signed a contract with Dassault Aviation to acquire 24 Rafale fighters in May 2015. The $7bn contract also includes an option for 12 additional fighters and the option was exercised by Qatar in December 2017. The company started the deliveries, with the first Rafale delivered to the Qatari Emiri Air Force in February 2019.\n\nThe French defence procurement agency (DGA) qualified the Rafale F3-R standard in October 2018. The F3-R is an advanced version of Rafale F3 standard with improved versatility. In March 2017, the French Government approved the development of new advanced Rafale F4 standard.\n\nThe company received the development contract for the Rafale F4 standard aircraft in January 2019. The validation of the latest standard is expected in 2024.\n\nRafale fighter aircraft development\n\nRafale B and C entered service with the French Air Force in June 2006, when the first squadron was established. The second airforce squadron was set up in 2008. A €3.1bn ($3.89bn) contract to develop the fully capable F3 standard aircraft was awarded to Dassault Aviation (€1.5bn), Snecma (€600m), Thales (€500m) and other French contractors by the French Ministry of Defence in February 2004.\n\nAn order for 59 F3 aircraft, 47 for the airforce (11 two-seat and 36 single-seat) and 12 (single-seat) for the navy, was placed in December 2004. The Rafale F3 was certified in July 2008. The contract also includes upgrades of the Rafale F2 aircraft.\n\nThe first Rafale F3 was delivered to the French Air Force in 2008. In March 2007, three French Air Force and three navy Rafale fighters were deployed in Tajikistan in support of the Nato International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.\n\nThe French Government ordered 60 additional Rafale aircraft in November 2009. Brazil’s Government awarded a $4bn contract to Dassault Aviation in January 2010 to supply 36 Rafale multirole aircraft.\n\nThe UAE was expected to acquire the Rafale under a $10bn contract to replace its 60 ageing Mirage fighters. In November 2011, however, the deal came to a standstill when the UAE termed Dassault’s price and terms as ‘uncompetitive’. The country is also considering Eurofighter’s Typhoon to replace its ageing Mirage fighters.\n\nIn February 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence selected Rafale for the Indian Air Force’s MMRCA (medium multirole combat aircraft) programme. The contract is worth approximately $20bn.\n\nRafale emerged as the preferred aircraft among various contenders for what is being called the biggest military aviation contract in the world. Its closest contender was Eurofighter’s Typhoon.\n\nUnder the contract, Dassault will supply 126 Rafale fighters. The first 18 fighters will be supplied by 2015 and the rest will be manufactured in India under a technology transfer to Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL). This contract will be the first international supply for Rafale.\n\nThe Indian Government finalised a contract in April 2015 for the acquisition of 36 (28 single-seat and eight dual-seat) Rafale aircraft. An intergovernmental deal worth €7.87bn ($8.82bn) was signed to facilitate the purchase in September 2016. France delivered the first aircraft to India in October 2019.\n\nDassault Aviation signed a sales contract with the Arab Republic of Egypt in February 2015 for the supply of 24 Rafale fighter aircraft. It completed the delivery of the 24th aircraft in July 2019.\n\nCockpit of Dassault’s Rafale Multirole Combat Fighter\n\nThe cockpit has hands-on throttle and stick control (HOTAS). The cockpit is equipped with a heads-up, wide-angle holographic display from Thales Avionique, which provides aircraft control data, mission data and firing cues.\n\nA collimated, multi-image head-level display presents tactical situation and sensor data, while two touchscreen lateral displays show the aircraft system parameters and mission data.\n\nThe pilot also has a helmet-mounted sight and display. A CCD camera and on-board recorder records the image of the head-up display throughout the mission.\n\nRafale fighter weapons\n\nRafale can carry payloads of more than 9t on 14 hardpoints for the airforce version, with 13 for the naval version. The range of weapons includes: Mica, Magic, Sidewinder, ASRAAM and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles; Apache, AS30L, ALARM, HARM, Maverick and PGM100 air-to-ground missiles and Exocet / AM39, Penguin 3 and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\n\nFor a strategic mission the Rafale can deliver the MBDA (formerly Aerospatiale) ASMP stand-off nuclear missile. In December 2004, the MBDA Storm Shadow / Scalp EG stand-off cruise missile was qualified on the Rafale.\n\nIn September 2005, the first flight of the MBDA Meteor BVRAAM beyond visual range air-to-air missile was conducted on a Rafale fighter. In December 2005, successful flight trials were carried out from the Charles de Gaulle of the range of Rafale’s weapon systems, Exocet, Scalp-EG, Mica, ASMP-A (to replace the ASMP) and Meteor missiles.\n\nIn April 2007, the Rafale carried out the first firing of the Sagem AASM precision-guided bomb, which has both GPS / inertial guidance and, optionally, imaging infrared terminal guidance. Rafale have been equipped with the AASM from 2008. Rafale can carry six AASM missiles, with each aiming to hit the target with 10m accuracy.\n\nThe Rafale has a twin gun pod and a Nexter (formerly Giat) 30mm DEFA 791B cannon, which can fire 2,500 rounds a minute. The Rafale is equipped with laser designation pods for laser guidance of air-to-ground missiles.\n\nCountermeasure and sensor technology on the twin-jet combat aircraft\n\nRafale’s electronic warfare system is the Spectra from Thales. Spectra incorporates solid state transmitter technology, a DAL laser warning receiver, missile warning, detection systems and jammers.\n\nThe Rafale multirole combat fighter is equipped with an RBE2 passive electronically scanned radar developed by Thales, which has look-down and shoot-down capabilities. The radar can track up to eight targets simultaneously and provides threat identification and prioritisation.\n\nThales developed an active electronically scanned version of the RBE2, which equipped the Rafale in February 2011. Flight tests of the radar onboard the Rafale took place in 2008.\n\nRUAG Aviation was awarded a $5m contract by Thales in May 2009 to produce sub-assemblies for the RBE2 radar to be equipped on the Rafale fighter jet.\n\nOptronic systems include the Thales / SAGEM OSF infrared search and track system, installed in the nose of the aircraft. The optronic suite carries out search, target identification, telemetry and automatic target discrimination and tracking.\n\nIn January 2012, the French Ministry of Defence awarded a ten-year contract to Thales to maintain the electronic systems and warfare of the aircraft.\n\nNavigation and communications of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale\n\nThe communications suite on the Rafale uses the Saturn onboard very/ultra-high frequency (V/UHF) radio, which is a second-generation, anti-jam tactical UHF radio for NATO. Saturn provides voice encryption in fast-frequency hopping mode.\n\nThe aircraft is also equipped with fixed-frequency VHF / UHF radio for communications with civil air traffic control. A multifunction information distribution system (MIDS) terminal provides secure, high-data-rate tactical data exchange with NATO C2 stations, AWACS aircraft or naval ships.\n\nThe Rafale multirole combat fighter is powered by two M88-2 engines, each providing a thrust of 75kN.\n\nRafale is equipped with a Thales TLS 2000 navigation receiver, which is used for the approach phase of flight. TLS 2000 integrates the instrument landing system (ILS), microwave landing system (MLS) and VHF omni-directional radio-ranger (VOR) and marker functions.\n\nThe radar altimeter is the AHV 17 altimeter from Thales, which is suitable for very low flight. The Rafale has a TACAN tactical air navigation receiver for en-route navigation and as a landing aid.\n\nThe Rafale has an SB25A combined interrogator-transponder developed by Thales. The SB25A is the first IFF using electronic scanning technology.\n\nRafale Multirole Combat Fighter engines\n\nThe Rafale is powered by two M88-2 engines from SNECMA, each providing a thrust of 75kN. The aircraft is equipped for buddy-buddy refuelling with a flight refuelling hose reel and drogue pack. The first M88 engine was delivered in 1996. It is a twin-shaft bypass turbofan engine principally suitable for low-altitude penetration and high-altitude interception missions.\n\nThe M88 incorporates the latest technologies such as single-piece bladed compressor disks (blisks), an on-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal high-pressure turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, ceramic coatings and composite materials.\n\nThe M88 engine comprises a three-stage LP compressor with inlet guide vane, an annular combustion chamber, single-stage cooled HP turbine, single-stage cooled LP turbine, radial A/B chamber, variable-section convergent flap-type nozzle and full authority digital engine control (FADEC).\n\nMessier-Dowty provides ‘jumper’ landing gear, designed to springout when the aircraft is catapulted by the nose gear strut.","title":"Rafale Multirole Combat Fighter, France","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/rafale-multirole-combat-fighter/","image":"https://www.airforce-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/Image-1-Rafale-Multirole-Combat-Fighter.jpg"}

(Courtesy: PTI Photo)\n\nThey are here. The five fighter aircraft from the French Aerospace Company Dassault Aviation landed at the Ambala Air Base late on Wednesday (July 29) after completing a journey of 7000 km from France to an airbase in UAE. After a gap of almost two-plus decades the Indian Air Force (IAF) has got a Western fighter jet in its inventory.\n\nMore about the aircraft\n\nIt is an ‘Omni role’ aircraft (can take on several missions in one sortie) and is classified as 4.5 generation fighter. It is considered to be one of the most potent fighters compared to the F-16 which the neighbouring country has or the JF-20 which Chinese claim is the 5th generation stealth aircraft.\n\nRafale is already flown in several critical missions across the globe in Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya. India has ordered 36 fighters (which means two squadrons). The fighters ordered will have around 13 Indian specific enhancements and are expected to be integrated into the machines once the full delivery is completed by next year-end. These enhancements include the ability to start in extreme weather conditions – very cold and high altitude, there is also an Israeli helmet-mounted display.\n\nThe Tail Numbers\n\nThe single-seaters will come with BS, and the twin-seater will have RB on its tail.\n\nWhy RB & BS?\n\nThe initial ‘RB’ on the trainer aircraft’s tail is the initials of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, who was the main lead in the negotiations of the deal. And the single-seater fighter jet will have the initial of the former Air Chief BS Dhanoa. And his initial is there as he was a deputy chief when the deal was being negotiated. The first aircraft which was handed over to defence minister Rajnath Singh last year in Paris has the tail number RB 001. This plane will be the last to arrive in India. As it is being used for training the second batch of pilots and crews, as well as testing out all the Indian specific enhancements.\n\nThe critical capabilities of the aircraft\n\nIt has a range of around 3,700 km and with 10-tonne empty weight. These aircraft are fitted with 14 hardpoints. Out of these, five can be used for dropping heavy ordnance as well as drop tanks. It has a total external load capacity of 9.5 tonnes. With the maximum speed of nearly twice the speed of sound, without the drag-chute, its ground run is around 450 meters.\n\nGame changer weapons on the French fighter\n\nThis aircraft could be the biggest game-changer for the IAF as it can be tuned to carry nuclear weapons too. Also, another significant game-changer is the Rs 20-crore worth Meteor air-to-air missile, which has been manufactured by the European company MBDA. This is a long-range rocket and ram-jet powered and has a range of over 150 km. It can hit the target without leaving the Indian airspace up to 120 km. Neither Pakistan nor China has these missiles from MBDA.\n\nAs has been reported earlier, the Rs 40 crore Scalp long-range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile is 5.1 metre long and weighs around 1,300 kg. With this missile fitted onboard the Rafale, the IAF will not have to leave the airspace to hit a target at 600 km in the enemy land.\n\nAccording to experts, the Scalp is a strategic weapon for the IAF which can be used for deep strikes, used in penetration or impact or airburst modes.\n\nAnd in the wake of ongoing tensions between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the IAF has ordered for the French HAMMER air-to-ground precision-guided weapon system. This has been done under the emergency procurement power which the three services have been given. It comes with a range extension kit which means that it can be fitted on standard bombs of different makes.\n\nThese aircraft can also be fitted with the Indo-Russian BrahMos NG when it is ready and the Mica air-to-air missiles can be fitted too.\n\nWhat radars and sensors are there onboard the machine?\n\nThe Indian version will have an Israeli Litening pod – it is used for sensor commonality across platforms in the Indian inventory.\n\nThere is RBE2 Active Electronically Scanned Radar too. It helps in giving unprecedented levels of situational awareness. This is possible due to earlier detection.\n\nFront Sector Optronics (FSO) system is there which is immune to radar jamming while operating in the optronic wavelengths.\n\nAlso, there is Spectra-integrated electronic warfare suite, which provides long-range detection, and identification of infrared, electromagnetic and laser threats.\n\nThe system onboard the fighter jet has radar, laser and missile warning receivers. There is a phased array radar jammer and a decoy dispenser for threat countering. This has been developed by MBDA and defence contractor Thales.","title":"IAF gets ‘game-changer’ Rafale fighter jets!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b71"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale jet","text":"Multi-role combat aircraft family by Dassault\n\nThe Dassault Rafale ( French pronunciation: ​ [ʁafal], literally meaning \"gust of wind\",[9] and \"burst of fire\" in a more military sense)[10] is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \"omnirole\" aircraft by Dassault.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.\n\nMany of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.\n\nIntroduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and Navy (Marine Nationale) had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service.[11] Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal.[12] In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller Dassault Mirage 2000, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles.[13]\n\nIn 1979, the French company Dassault joined the MBB/BAe \"European Collaborative Fighter\" (ECA) project which was renamed the \"European Combat Aircraft\".[14] The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin-engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country.[13] In 1983, the \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.[15]\n\nA number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new EFA programme.[11][N 1] In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project.[17][18] Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon.[19]\n\nDesign phase and prototype\n\nIn France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The French Ministry of Defence required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground, all-day and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's airframe, avionics, propulsion system and armament, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the French Armed Forces. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the Jaguar, Mirage F1C/CR/CT, Mirage 2000C/-5/N in the Armée de l'air, and the F-8P Crusader, Étendard IVP/M and Super Étendard in the Aéronavale.[11][20]\n\nDuring October–December 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning \"Tactical Combat Airplane\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace (meaning \"Bird of Prey\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin.[13] In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a technology demonstrator named Avion de Combat expérimental (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.[13][21]\n\nThe Dassault \"Rafale A\" technology demonstrator in 2006\n\nThe resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system.[11] Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the DGA, France's defence procurement agency.[13] The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in Saint-Cloud, and took its maiden flight on 4 July 1986 from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in southern France.[11] During the one-hour flight, the project's chief test pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of 11,000 metres (36,000 ft) and a speed of Mach 1.3. The 9.5-tonne (21,000 lb) demonstrator stopped in 300 metres (980 ft) upon landing.[22]\n\nThroughout the flight test programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers Clemenceau and Foch to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of Mach 2 (2,450 km/h; 1,520 mph; 1,320 kn) and a height of 13,000 metres (42,000 ft).[23] The demonstrator was initially powered by General Electric F404-GE-400 afterburning turbofans from the F/A-18 Hornet, instead of the Snecma M88, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme.[11][24] It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach 1.4 and demonstrate supercruise, or sustained supersonic flight without use of afterburners. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.[11][23][25]\n\nAt the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac declared that the country would proceed with the US$30 billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996.[26][27][28][29] However, the fall of the Berlin Wall, which signalled the end of the Cold War, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million.[30][31] This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.[11][32][33]\n\nRafale logo\n\nDuring the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging F-8 Crusader, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \"interoperability testing\" aboard the French aircraft carrier Foch. The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.[34][35]\n\nTesting\n\nA two-seater Rafale B during aerial refueling\n\nTo meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \"Rafale C\" (chasseur, meaning \"fighter\" or literally \"hunter\") and the \"Rafale B\" (biplace, or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, man-machine interface and weapons, and expand the flight envelope.[36] Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.[37]\n\nThe C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight.[38] The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993.[36] It was 350 kilograms (770 lb) heavier than the single-seater, but carried 400 litres (110 US gal) less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two 2,000-litre (530 US gal) external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.[39]\n\nA French Navy Rafale M with tail hook deployed during landing aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing Étendard IV Ms & Ps, F-8P Crusaders and Super Étendard Modernisés. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long-term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993.[36][40] Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July–August 1992 and early the following year, at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier Foch in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerhervé, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993.[41]\n\nProduction and upgrades\n\nInitially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the Gulf War showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and reconnaissance missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet.[42] The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \"A\" and 139 \"B\" models\",[40][43] and later to 212 aircraft.[42] The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts.[40][42] Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns,[43] though the two-seater was later cancelled.[23]\n\nProduction of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007.[42] A further order of 59 F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004.[44] In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180.[45]\n\nDuring the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of Dassault Systèmes' CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional computer-aided design, manufacture and engineering software suite that would become standard across the industry.[46] CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as digital mockup and product data management. It consisted of 15 GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support.[46]\n\nThe Rafale final assembly site is located adjacent to Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport\n\nAccording to the French magazine L'Usine nouvelle, apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport. For example, the flight control surfaces are fabricated in Haute-Savoie, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in Val-d'Oise, and the engines in Essonne.[47] Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, Thales and Safran, who rely on a network of 500 subcontractors. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. As of 2012 , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft.[47]\n\nDeliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999.[48] Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board Charles de Gaulle; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the Gulf of Oman, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations.[49] In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training.[40]\n\nThe total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around €45.9 billion,[8] which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately €160.5 million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation.[50] The unit flyaway price as of 2010 was €101.1 million for the F3+ version.[51]\n\nIn 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch miniaturised satellites.[52] In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser-targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity.[53] In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced.[54][55]\n\nIn January 2014, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that €1 billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018.[56][57] The Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later,[58] until replacement by the Franco-German New Generation Fighter.\n\nFuture replacement\n\nIn 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the New Generation Fighter. This fighter aircraft under development by Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence and Space, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2035-40 timeframe.[59]\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with active close-coupled canard to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from −3.6g to 9g (10.5g on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11g can be reached in case of emergency[60][61]). The Rafale is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft and uses digital fly-by-wire flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability.[61][N 2] The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to 115 knots (213 km/h; 132 mph); while in flight, airspeeds as low as 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) have been observed during training missions.[61] According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications.[63]\n\nThe Rafale M features a greatly reinforced undercarriage to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an arrestor hook, and \"jump strut\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including catapult launches.[36] It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based microwave landing system, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the inertial navigation system to external equipment.[39] Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) compared to other variants.[41] The Rafale M retains about 95 percent commonality with Air Force variants including,[64] although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of Charles de Gaulle, France's first nuclear-powered carrier, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, Foch and Clemenceau.[39]\n\nRadar signature\n\nS-duct air intake conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS\n\nAlthough not a full-aspect stealth aircraft, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature .[65][66] In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail-fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine air inlets underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of composite materials and serrated patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards.[58][65] Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite.[67] Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified.[62]\n\nCockpit\n\nThe Rafale's glass cockpit was designed around the principle of data fusion—a central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control.[68] The primary flight controls are arranged in a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed side-stick controller and a left-handed throttle.[69] The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29° to improve g-force tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view.[70] An intelligent flight suit worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.[71]\n\nGreat emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations.[62] Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls.[69] Developed by Crouzet, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and countermeasures systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions.[72] For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.[73]\n\nFor displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment.[74] Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of human–computer interaction (HCI).[13] A head-mounted display (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles.[69][75][76] The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG).[69]\n\nIn the area of life support, the Rafale is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mark 16F \"zero-zero\" ejection seat, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board oxygen generating system, developed by Air Liquide, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters.[77] The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The auto-pilot and autothrottle controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls.[69]\n\nAvionics and equipment\n\nThe Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface.[62][N 3] The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self-protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft.[78] The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters,[79] and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the Airbus A380.[80] According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life.[62]\n\nAnnotated diagram of SPECTRA 's elements\n\nThe Rafale features an integrated defensive-aids system named SPECTRA, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and MBDA.[81] Various methods of detection, jamming, and decoying have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub-systems in the future.[82][N 4] Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) platforms.[83]\n\nThe Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods,[84] such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod.[78] Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot.[85] Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a FLIR.[85]\n\nThe Damocles designation pod was described as \"lacking competitiveness\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods;[86] so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds.[87] A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show[88] and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018.[89] Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms.[90][N 5] Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.[85]\n\nRadar and sensors\n\nThe Rafale was first outfitted with the Thales RBE2 passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain-following and the real-time generation of high resolution ground maps for navigation and targeting.[91] In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months.[66] In September 2006, Flight International reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range.[92]\n\nThe RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200 km,[93] improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar.[94] A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway.[90] In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \"on time and on budget\").[94] By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013.[95]\n\nTo enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or Optronique Secteur Frontal (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and infrared wavelengths.[96] The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the MICA at beyond visual range distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea.[97] Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance.[91] In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally.[94]\n\nArmament and standards\n\nInitial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the F1 (\"France 1\") standard, these had been equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations.[98] Later deliveries were to the \"F2\" standard, which added the capability for conducting both air-to-ground and reconnaissance operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006.[99] Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s.[69][76]\n\nWeapons of the Rafale\n\nF3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air-to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using SCALP EG cruise missiles and AASM Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 Exocet sea skimming missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with ASMP-A missiles.[100] In 2010, France ordered 200 MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service.[101][102]\n\nThe F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.[103]\n\nFor compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with MIL-STD-1760, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment.[62] The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 hardpoints (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30 mm GIAT 30 revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions.[62] According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility.[62]\n\nEngines\n\nCloseup of the rear of the airframe and the two engine nozzles\n\nRafale B in a clean configuration\n\nThe Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to 50 kilonewtons (11,000 pounds-force) of dry thrust and 75 kN (17,000 lb f ) with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures.[62] The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.[104][105]\n\nQualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year.[106] Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine.[11][107] In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2.[108] The engine is of a modular design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard.[106] There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[109] As of 2007, a thrust vectoring variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development.[98]\n\nOperational history\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Naval Aviation\n\nIn December 2000, the French Naval Aviation (Aéronavale), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron Flottille 12F, which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale.[110] Flottille 12F immediately participated in Trident d'Or aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with warships from ten other nations. During the maritime exercise, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings.[110][111] After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004.[112]\n\nThe Rafale M is fully compatible with US Navy aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks.[113] On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on USS Harry S. Truman, a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier.[114]\n\nIn 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard Charles de Gaulle of the French Navy during \"Mission Héraclès\", the French participation in \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while Charles de Gaulle was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India-Pakistan border.[13][115]\n\nIn 2016, Rafales operating from Charles de Gaulle struck targets associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[116]\n\nIn December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while Charles de Gaulle undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions.[117] Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and 17F, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard USS George H.W. Bush for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at Naval Air Station Oceana.[118]\n\nFrench Air Force\n\nFormation of five Rafales making a flypast in 2006\n\nRafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that Escadron de Chasse (Fighter Squadron) 1/7 at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8–10 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when EC 1/7 would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters).[112][119]\n\nIn 2007, after a \"crash program\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to Dushanbe in Tajikistan, while the three others were Rafale Marine of the Navy on board Charles De Gaulle.[120] The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first GBU-12 was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational début of the Rafale.[121] Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at Kandahar International Airport to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces.[122]\n\nOn 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and strike missions over Libya in Opération Harmattan, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of Benghazi.[123] The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead.[83] On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway.[124]\n\nDuring the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \"Hammer\" bombs, a Thales Damoclès targeting pod and two drop tanks;[83] these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft.[125] The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between 125 kilograms (280 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions.[125] Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow SCALP weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra.[126] In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground-attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the close air support role.[125]\n\nA French Air Force Rafale B during Operation Serval in Mali, 2013\n\nIn January 2013, the Rafale took part in \"Opération Serval\", the French military intervention in support to the government of Mali against the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa.[127] The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of Gao, eastern Mali.[128] Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from Timbuktu and Douentza.[129] Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali.[130]\n\nIn August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall.[131]\n\nIn September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of Opération Chammal, France's contribution to the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[132][133] On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zummar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.[134][135]\n\nIn April 2018, during the Syrian Civil War, five Rafale B fighters from the Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Each jet was loaded with two SCALP EG missiles.[136]\n\nEgypt\n\nIn November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement.[137] By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the Suez Canal expansion in August 2015.[138]\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales,[139] as part of a larger deal, including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and missiles, worth US$5.9 billion (€5.2 billion).[140][141] The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in Istres.[142] In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters.[143] All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force.[144] Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single-seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the Egyptian Air Force.[145] Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017.[146] The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales.[147]\n\nIn June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract.[148][149] An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations.[150]\n\nQatar\n\nA Qatari Rafale at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in 2019.\n\nStarting in 2011, the Qatar Emiri Air Force evaluated the Rafale alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Boeing F-15E, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace its Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales.[151] On 30 April 2015, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani announced to French President François Hollande that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft.[152] On 4 May, a €6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as €263M for each aircraft.[153][154] On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for €1.1 billion (or €92M each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters.[155] The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019.[156][157]\n\nIndia\n\nRafale of the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale.[158] In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs.[159] In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4 billion contract.[160] On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder.[161][162] It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under transfer of technology agreements.[163][164] The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion.[165][166]\n\nThe deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The Indian Defence Ministry instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft.[167][168] In May 2013, The Times of India reported that negotiations were \"back on track\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017.[169] Another point of contention was a provision where Dassault was to reinvest 50 percent of the deal's earnings into India's defence sectors, either through purchases or technological expertise.[170][171] In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL.[172] By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015.[173]\n\nA Rafale landing at Ambala Air Force Station on its first arrival in India on 29 July 2020.\n\nIn April 2015, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris, India requested the rapid delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition.[174][175] Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years.[176] India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015.[177] Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities.[178] In January 2016, the Indian government directed the Indian Navy to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters.[179] Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales.[180] On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a €7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price.[181] The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years.[182] The deal includes weapons and spares, which included Meteor BVRAAM missiles.[183][184] India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China.[185]\n\nThe Indian National Congress raised an issue over Dassault partnering with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence, now known as Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited(R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner; Gandhi alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence.[186][187] Party spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹7.15 billion to ₹16 billion.[188] In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the Supreme Court for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal.[189][190]\n\nIn March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing MiG-21s and to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s.[191] Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart; it had tail number \"RB-001\" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal.[192]\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.[193]\n\nDelivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Airforce from France.[194]\n\nPotential operators\n\nAnalysts view the relatively quick series of 84[195] orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the Arab Spring and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East.[196]\n\nFinland\n\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[197]\n\nIn December 2015 Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the United States where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program.[198] The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.[199]\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) Mikoyan MiG-29, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[200] In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region.[201][202]\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs.[203] A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated.[204] Although a leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds,[N 6] on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs.[206] Due to a referendum, this purchase never happened.\n\nIn March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35.[207][208] In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons.[209] In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at Payerne Air Base for comparison against other bids.[210]\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nIn 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles.[211] In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed.[212] However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Union Defence Force, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in November 2011 called the French offer \"uncompetitive and unworkable\";[213] France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6 billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale.[214] Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon[215] or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[216]\n\nThe newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait.[217] In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit.[218] In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft.[219] In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s.[220] In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales.[221] In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE.[222]\n\nOthers\n\nSpain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.[223]\n\nIn January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its air force.[224]\n\nFailed bids\n\nThe Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100 million (2010),[225] while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour.[226] The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate.[226] According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.[227]\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance offered economic and technology partnerships in its bid for the Rafale to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters starting in 2023 as part of the air combat capability successor program. Other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35.[228] On 25 October 2018, Belgium selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace around 54 F-16s; government officials stated that the decision came down to price and that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven valuation criteria\"; the total purchasing price for the aircraft and support until 2030 totaled €4 billion, €600 million cheaper than the initial budget of €4.6 billion.[229][230]\n\nBrazil\n\nIn June 2008, the Brazilian Air Force issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, Su-35, Gripen NG and Eurofighter Typhoon.[231] In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2 – Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F.[232] On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs.[233][234] In February 2011, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18.[235] After delays due to budget constraints,[236] in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5 billion deal to equip the air force.[237]\n\nCanada\n\nThe Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fleet.[238] In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions.[239] In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002.[240][241] In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin.[242] In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition.[243] Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35.[244] In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs.[245][246] In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.[247][248]\n\nKuwait\n\nIn February 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales.[249] In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms.[250] Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests.[251] In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18–22 Rafales.[252] However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons.[253][254]\n\nLibya\n\nIn January 2007, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24 billion\".[255] In December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi declared Libya's interest in the Rafale,[256] but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international military intervention during the 2011 Libyan civil war.[257]\n\nSingapore\n\nIn 2005, the Republic of Singapore Air Force embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. A number of options were considered and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two – Dassault Rafale and the F-15SG Strike Eagle. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft.[258] According to Defense Industry Daily, one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration.[259]\n\nOthers\n\nIn 2002, the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F-15K Slam Eagle over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft F-X Phase 1 fighter competition.[260]\n\nDuring 2006, while there was potentially trouble with Anglo-American negotiations over the F-35 Lightning II, there was talk of purchasing the Rafale M for Britain's Royal Navy.[261] However, in May 2012, after having abandoned the F-35B STOVL version in favour of the F-35C CATOBAR variant in October 2010, the UK reverted to purchasing the F-35B.[262][263]\n\nIn late 2007, La Tribune reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead.[264][265] While French Defense Minister Herve Morin labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations.[265][266]\n\nIn February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of SEPECAT Jaguars.[267] In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons.[268][269]\n\nVariants\n\nRafale B/C and M\n\nRafale A Technology demonstrator, first flew in 1986.[11] Rafale D Dassault used this designation (D for discrète) in the early 1990s to emphasise the new semi-stealthy design features.[270] Rafale B F3-R Two-seater version for the French Air Force.[36] \"It can operate with the Talios targeting pod (45 ordered by French army will delivered between 2019 and 2023).\"[271] Rafale C F3-R Same as Rafale B F3-R but Single-seat version for the French Air Force.[36] Rafale M F3-R Same as Rafale C F3-R but Carrier-borne version for the French Naval Aviation, which entered service in 2001. For carrier operations, the M model has a strengthened airframe, longer nose gear leg to provide a more nose-up attitude, larger tailhook between the engines, and a built-in boarding ladder. Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg (1,100 lb) more than the Rafale C.[36][272] It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise.[273] Rafale N Originally called the Rafale BM, was a planned missile-only two-seater version for the Aéronavale.[49] Budgetary and technical constraints have been cited as grounds for its cancellation.[23] Rafale R Proposed reconnaissance-oriented variant.[65] Rafale DM Two-seater version for the Egyptian Air Force.[274] Rafale EM Single-seat version for the Egyptian Air Force.[275] Rafale DH Two-seater version for the Indian Air Force.[276] Rafale EH Single-seat version for the Indian Air Force.[6] Rafale B, C, M F4 ( first step 4.1, second step 4.2) It will upgrade radar (F4.1), as well as improved capabilities in the Helmet-Mounted Display and AASM 1000 kg, OSF (long range optoelectronics system) will be receive an IRST( Infrared Search and Track ) for detecting and identifying airborne stealth targets at long range (F4.1), it will be more effective in network-centric warfare, more data exchange and satellite communication and will launch small (F4.2) . It as be ordered in 2019.:All 180 French Rafale B,C,M will be upgraded to F4.1 in 2022 and F4.2 in 2027,[271][277] moreover a further 30 aircraft at the full F4 standard (F4.2) will be ordered in 2023 and delivered between 2027 and 2030.[278]\n\nOperators\n\nMap with Dassault Rafale operators in blue, with orders in cyan\n\nFrance A total of 180 have been ordered out of a planned 286, with an option for another 9.[76] Approximately 152 are confirmed to be delivered by 2018.[279][280] As of 2017 , 149 had been delivered. In 2018 three Rafale will be delivered, and then in 2024 all the 28 remaining out of the 180 ordered will be delivered.[276][281][282]\n\nEgyptian Air Force – 24 Rafales in service of the 24 ordered as of December 2018.[147][286]\n\nQatar Air Force – Qatar ordered 24 of the fighters in 2015, adding 12 more in 2018. It also has an option to buy 36 more.[290] As of February 2020, 23 were delivered.[291]\n\nNotable accidents\n\nOn 6 December 2007, a French Air Force twin-seat Rafale crashed during a training flight. The pilot, who suffered from spatial disorientation, was killed in the accident. [292]\n\nOn 24 September 2009, after unarmed test flights, two French Navy Rafales returning to the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, collided in mid-air about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the town of Perpignan in southwest France. One test pilot, identified as François Duflot, was killed in the accident, while the other was rescued.[293]\n\nSpecifications\n\nAASM-Hammer family of weapons\n\nMICA: short- to medium-range air-to-air missile\n\nData from Dassault Aviation,[294] Superfighters,[295] French Navy,[296] International Directory of Military Aircraft[297]\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 1 or 2\n\n1 or 2 Length: 15.27 m (50 ft 1 in)\n\n15.27 m (50 ft 1 in) Wingspan: 10.90 m (35 ft 9 in)\n\n10.90 m (35 ft 9 in) Height: 5.34 m (17 ft 6 in)\n\n5.34 m (17 ft 6 in) Wing area: 45.7 m 2 (492 sq ft)\n\n45.7 m (492 sq ft) Empty weight: 10,300 kg (22,708 lb) (B)[69][294]\n\nGross weight: 15,000 kg (33,069 lb)\n\n15,000 kg (33,069 lb) Max takeoff weight: 24,500 kg (54,013 lb)\n\n24,500 kg (54,013 lb) Fuel capacity: 4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( C ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( B )\n\n4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( ) Maximum fuel: ( C ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) [ citation needed ]\n\n( ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) Powerplant: 2 × Snecma M88-2 turbofans, 50.04 kN (11,250 lbf) thrust each [298] dry, 75 kN (17,000 lbf) with afterburner\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 2,223 km/h (1,381 mph, 1,200 kn) [299] / Mach 1.8[300] at high altitude\n\n1,390 km/h, 860 mph, 750 kn / Mach 1.1 at low altitude\n\nSupercruise: [301] Mach 1.4 [ citation needed ]\n\nMach 1.4 Combat range: 1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs.\n\n1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs. Ferry range: 3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks\n\n3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks Service ceiling: 15,835 m (51,952 ft)\n\n15,835 m (51,952 ft) g limits: + 9 − 3.6 ( + 11 in emergencies) [60] [302] [303]\n\n9 3.6 ( 11 in emergencies) Rate of climb: 304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min)\n\n304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min) Wing loading: 328 kg/m 2 (67 lb/sq ft)\n\n328 kg/m (67 lb/sq ft) Thrust/weight: 0.988 (100% fuel, 2 EM A2A missile, 2 IR A2A missile) version B\n\nArmament\n\n\n\nAvionics\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nRelated lists\n\nNotes\n\n^ [16] Quote: \"Dassault demands design leadership as the price for European co-operation.\" ^ [62] Quote: \"Longitudinal stability is moderately negative with a full fly-by-wire digital control system.

The two armies are locked in a bitter standoff in the region for seven weeks.On June 2, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a telephonic conversation with his French counterpart Florence Parly during which she conveyed that the Rafale jets will be delivered to India as scheduled notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic in France.Military officials, on the condition of anonymity, said the arrival of the Rafale jets will significantly enhance the IAF's overall combat capability and will send a clear message to India's \"adversaries\".When asked about the matter, the IAF did not comment.The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala air force station , considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jetsMeteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile ( BVRAAM ) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and SwedenBesides the missile systems, the Rafale jets will come with various India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low-band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems among othersThe IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two basesOut of the 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.The Congress had raised questions on the deal, including on rates of the aircraft, and alleged corruption, but the government had rejected the charges.","title":"First batch of six Rafale jets likely to arrive in India by July 27; to be based in Ambala","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/first-batch-of-six-rafale-jets-likely-to-arrive-in-india-by-july-27-to-be-based-in-ambala/articleshow/76688506.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76688520,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-168234,overlay-etdefence/photo.jpg"}

The jets are fitted with “deadly” missiles and weapons, which are a way ahead when compared with similar capabilities of Pakistan and China.\n\nFeatures of the war bird Top speed 1,389 km/h\n\nRange 3,700 km\n\nWeight 9,979 kg This will be the first induction of the new type of foreign-origin jets since Sukhoi started coming in late 1990s. A total of 272 Sukhoi are on order. Another 12, other than these 272, are to be added. Deliveries of such huge numbers are usually staggered. The only other induction of jets has been LCA Tejas, an indigenous product.\n\nLast week, the Indian Air Force (IAF) had said its pilots and ground crew, after having undergone training, were “fully operational”. India and China are locked in a tense stand-off since early May. Owing to Ambala’s location, Rafale can take off and fly northeastwards towards the G219 highway of China.\n\nFive of these Rafale jets will be flown in from France by Indian pilots. They will be fuelled mid-air. Pilots will take a break at the base of a friendly country in West Asia before flying into Ambala. Post-arrival, efforts will focus on operationalising the aircraft at the earliest. A formal induction ceremony will take place in the second half of August.\n\nThe jets come fitted with weapons and missiles from European missile-maker MBDA. These will include Meteor, a beyond visual range air-to-air missile, that can hit enemy targets in the air 150 km away. The Meteor is powered by a rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power and much longer range. This means it can travel much farther, giving Meteor the ability to chase down and destroy agile hostile fighters.\n\nIndia’s Rafale fighters will also be equipped with the SCALP deep-strike cruise missile. It can strike at hardened and protected targets deep inside hostile territory without the need for Rafale to enter hostile airspace. SCALP has long range, around 300 km, and it can hit targets in Pakistan and China even if it is hovering over Jalandhar or even Chandigarh.\n\nImportance\n\nRafale is a medium multi-role combat aircraft that is said to boost India’s air dominance exponentially, currently safeguarded by fighter jets like Russia-made Sukhoi Su-30MKI and MiG-29, along with French Mirage-2000 and indigenously built HAL Tejas.","title":"Rafale 1st imported jet since 90s","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-1st-imported-jet-since-90s-118391","image":"https://cmsimages.tribuneindia.com/gallary_content/2020/7/Desk/2020_7$largeimg_1001134609.jpg"}

An IAF spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the development.\n\nHighlights The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence.\n\nIt can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard-points.\n\nThe two Rafale squadrons will be based at Ambala in Haryana and Hasimara in West Bengal, covering the western and eastern fronts.\n\nThe Indian fighters will be equipped with Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles built by European defence major MBDA Missile Systems.\n\nThe Meteor’s no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium range air-to-air missiles.\n\nIndia-specific enhancements on the jets include helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with enough storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.\n\nIndia ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.\n\n“We are aware that around 10 Rafale jets are ready at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility. Preparations are on to fly six Rafale jets to India in July-end with a stopover at Al Dhafra air base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The jets will be flown by Indian pilots,” said the second person cited above, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAll the 10 fighters are not being delivered in the first batch as some jets are needed in France to train IAF crews, he said.\n\nThe French air force will refuel the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra from where aerial refueling support is expected to be provided by the IAF’s Russian IL-78 refuellers, the second person said.\n\nExperts said accelerating the deliveries of Rafale jets was a significant development amid the ongoing border tensions with China.\n\n“It’s good that the Rafale delivery is being expedited as its operationalisation here would get advanced. Since we are in for the long haul on our northern borders, their availability with the IAF would add to its offensive potential,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.\n\nApart from the first batch, future deliveries of Rafale fighters are also being expedited, said the first person cited above.\n\nAccording to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022.\n\nFrance handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.\n\nThe IAF has raised its guard to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert. Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the United States --- in the region.\n\nThe IAF and the Indian Army have deployed their air defence systems in eastern Ladakh even as the PLA-Air Force has activated several of its bases in both Xinjiang and the Tibet Autonomous Region with Chinese fighter jets regularly making a show of strength in the Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday.\n\nBoth India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and missiles in the region that has garnered extensive global attention in recent weeks, particularly after the bloodshed along the LAC in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty. An unconfirmed number of Chinese troops were also killed in the Galwan Valley brawl.","title":"France speeds up Rafale fighter jet deliveries on IAF’s ‘special request’","author":["Rahul Singh"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1593419467000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-speeds-up-rafale-fighter-jet-deliveries-on-iaf-s-special-request/story-d52eideBabhi6BG9Nhmu5J.html","image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/06/29/Pictures/_a2c5b978-b9e2-11ea-8df8-49382d26f353.jpg"}

Four aircraft will come for sure while an attempt is being made to ensure that a total of six jets come,” said a source.\n\nAccording to sources, the jets can be deployed for combat quicker than anticipated as France has diverted some of the game-changing missiles — Meteor and SCALP — meant for its own air force to the Rafale jets for India. Originally, this was supposed to happen months after the delivery of the fighter jets.\n\nThePrint had first reported on 20 March that the delivery of the Rafale fighter jets could get delayed from its original May date due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On 14 April, ThePrint reported that the delivery will take place only in July.\n\nAlso read: If you don’t shoot, you don’t escalate: NSAB chief explains how India, China have avoided war\n\nWill fly via UAE, with two mid-air refuellers\n\nAccording to the plan, the Rafale jets will take off from Istres in France and fly to the French airbase in Al Dhafra near Abu Dhabi in the UAE.

It will have a halt for the night and next day fly to Ambala,” another source told ThePrint.\n\nThe initial plan was that the aircraft would arrive after layovers in multiple countries. However, the Covid pandemic meant that the pilots would have to undergo quarantine at each base, said the sources.\n\nIt has now been decided that two French Airbus mid-air refuellers will fly with the jets. There would be at least two rounds of mid-air refuelling on the way to UAE, the sources said.\n\nIndian mid-air refuellers will take charge the next day for the journey to Ambala. Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots are now getting trained in France for refuelling. This was not part of the original training, said the sources.\n\nFrance diverts missiles to IAF\n\nThe contract India and France signed in September 2016 had said the Rafale delivery would take place in May 2020, and the main weapons package would arrive in October, said the sources.\n\nHowever, following a request, France has diverted the missiles made for its air force to India. These have started arriving already.\n\nThese missiles include the beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 km away, and the long range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 km away.\n\n“This means that the Rafale could be combat-ready much earlier than expected. The Meteor and SCALP have already been integrated with the Rafales which are coming in,” another source said.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 km away without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-metre-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 km in enemy territory.\n\nAlso read: Kargil hero Col Wangchuk says need strong political will to strengthen India’s borders\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

Rafale fighter jets belong to the 4 ++ generation would not have been of much use had an aerial conflict broken out in Ladakh again the PLAAF.\n\nAs reported by EurAsian Times, India and China had been engaged in a brutal conflict in the Himalayan region of Ladakh. Troops of both countries have exchanged blows and even lost soldiers in the conflict that began more than a month ago.\n\nKeeping in mind the situation in Ladakh, France said that it would accelerate the delivery of Rafale fighter jets to India. Aviation experts believe that the arrival of Rafale fighter jets will significantly boost the combat capability of the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, according to Russian experts, who did not wish to be named, the French fighter would not help India much incase the conflict turns hot.\n\nThe astronomical cost of Rafale fighter jets is one of the reasons the French 4++ fighter jet would not help India. In the deal struck with Paris, New Delhi agreed to purchase 36 Rafale Jets. The total cost of the deal was an estimated Rs 59,000 crore with each jet costing around Rs 1,646 crore.\n\nThe cost of a Rafale is about three times higher than the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter jets. In other words, for 36 French-made Rafale fighters that will appear in the Indian Air Force, China can respond with three times as many of its fifth-generation J-20 fighters – for the same money.\n\nEven if, in some ways, the characteristics of the Chinese combat aircraft lag behind the French 4 ++ fighter jet, then the Indian air force could get overwhelmed by what is called “capable of crushing by quantity”.\n\nAnd the cost is not the only reason why Rafale jets would not help India much. Compared to another Chinese jet – J-16 (an analogue of the Russian Su-35) which Beijing is also using in its airforce, the Rafale jets will find it extremely challenging to outgun the Russian Su-35s operated by the Chinese.\n\nThe maximum speed of the Rafale jet is about Mach 1.8 and the J-16 is Mach 2.2. The Rafale’s practical ceiling is also lower than the J-16s. Even in engine thrust, the Chinese J-16s aka Russian Su-35s are far superior to the French combat aircraft.\n\nEven if the IAF was to deploy all 36 of its newly acquired jets, the technical superiority would still be on the side of China, claims the Russian expert.\n\nThe IAF has been on high alert in Ladakh and is closely monitoring all Chinese activity near the Line of Control. As reported by EurAsian Times, New Delhi has inked a deal with Moscow to buy 33 new fighter aircraft including 12 Su-30MKIs and 21 MiG-29s along with up-gradation of 59 MiG-29s. The addition and up-gradation of jets have been approved to strengthen India’s air power.\n\nThe air defence systems of both the Indian Army and the IAF have been deployed in Ladakh to prevent any misadventure by the Chinese Air Force fighter jets or the People’s Liberation Army choppers there.","title":"Indian Rafale Jets Would Have Been Useless Against Chinese Airforce – Russia Experts","author":["Eurasian Times Desk"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1594351330000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://eurasiantimes.com/indian-rafale-jets-would-have-been-useless-against-chinese-airforce-russia-experts/","image":"https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rafale-1.jpg"}

Dhanoa, Rafale is a “game changer”.\n\nEncapsulating what the Rafales bring in, ACM Bhadauria said in February that at the time of the Kargil conflict in 1999, India had an edge over Pakistan in terms of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile capability. “We allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade-and-a-half of struggle in the acquisition process to be able to get better capability,” he said. The Rafale, armed with the Meteor BVR air-to-air missile, will restore that edge in the neighbourhood as there is no equivalent to it currently.\n\nAccording to its manufacturer Dassault Aviation, Rafale is an omni-role fighter capable of the entire spectrum of roles — air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. With its advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, electronic warfare suite and network-centric capabilities in addition to its armaments, Rafale is now the most advanced fighter in the IAF arsenal, overtaking the SU-30MKI, which is due for major upgrades.\n\nRafale is also the first imported fighter to join service in over two decades since the SU-30s in the late 1990s. Rafale has 14 hard points for weapons and can carry a total external load of over 9 tonnes. In addition to the Meteor, it is armed with SCALP long-range stand-off attack air-to-ground missiles and MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles. The latest addition, HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) medium range air-to-ground missiles, is being procured through the emergency route.\n\nAnother significant factor with the Rafales is that as per contract, at least 75% of the Rafale fleet has to be operationally available, which would make it the most available fighter in the IAF fleet. The first Rafale squadron, No. 17 Golden Arrows, will be based at Ambala and the second squadron will be at Hasimara. All 36 aircraft will be delivered on schedule by end 2021, the Indian Embassy in France said last week.\n\nThe €7.87 billion (₹59,262 crore) inter-governmental agreement, signed in September 2016 between India and France for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition, also includes 13 India-Specific Enhancements (ISE), the non-recurring design and development cost of which is ₹9,855 crore. Some of them pertain to radar enhancements, helmet mounted display, ability to start and operate from high altitude airfields, advanced infrared search and track sensor and a very potent electronic jammer pod.\n\nThe deal also epitomises the cumbersome defence procurement process in which government-to-government deals have of late become the way out. Rafale was originally selected under the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft tender issued in 2007, which itself was conceived as a Mig-21 replacement project in early 2000s. Rafale was selected in 2012 but negotiations got stuck due to differences and the tender was eventually withdrawn after the emergency purchase announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April 2015, citing “critical operational necessity” of the IAF.\n\nFalling numbers\n\nHowever, the 36 Rafales will do little to arrest the falling numbers of fighter squadrons of the IAF, which has a sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons but is down to 31 at present. To offset that, the IAF is banking on the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). A contract for 83 LCA-Mk1A is in final stages and they are in addition to the 40 jets already contracted for. A more advanced LCA-Mk2 is also in the works. The government has recently approved the procurement of 21 MIG-29 jets from Russia, which will add two additional squadrons. In addition, 12 SU-30MKI aircraft have also been approved, which will replenish the numbers of Sukhois lost in crashes. The IAF will also phase out five squadrons of Mig-21s in the the next few years.\n\nWhile the IAF works to keep the numbers from falling further, the Rafale, which joins the IAF at a time of unprecedented tensions on the border with China, will give a qualitative edge to the force in the region.","title":"Rafale jets | The ‘game-changer’ fighters","author":["Law In Question Is Unconstitutional","Rooted In Colonialism","They Say","In The Past Months","They Were Done Primarily Through Embassies"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-jets-the-game-changer-fighters/article32249724.ece","image":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l9uzfv/article32249721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-RAFALE-1"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b7d"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale jet","text":"India on Wednesday received its first batch of new combat-proven fighter aircraft with the arrival of five Rafale jets, giving the country's air power a strategic edge. The aircraft, having an undisputed track record and considered one of the most potent combat jets globally, landed at the Ambala Air Force airbase at around 3.14 pm after covering a distance of 7,000 km from the Merignac airbase in French port city of Bordeaux.\n\nEach jet was given a special water cannon salute at the strategically-located airbase in the presence of top brass of the Indian Air Force including Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria who had played a key role as lead negotiator in the procurement of the jets. Welcoming the arrival of the jets, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a tweet in Sanskrit, said there is no virtue like protecting the nation and there is no vow like the defence of the nation.\n\n\"The Birds have landed safely in Ambala,\" Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted as soon as the aircraft touched down. At the same time, he used the occasion to send a veiled message to China. \"I would like to add, if it is anyone who should be worried about or critical about this new capability of the Indian Air Force, it should be those who want to threaten our territorial integrity,\" the defence minister said. The Rafales were escorted by two Sukhoi 30 MKIs after they entered the Indian air space.\n\nA look at how Rafale fighters will be a gamechanger against Pakistan and China:\n\n* Rafale vs China’s Chengdu J-20:\n\n* Combat proven: While China’s Chengdu J-20 jets are called fifth-generation combat jets, compared to 4.5 generation Rafale, the J-20 have no actual combat experience while Rafale has been used by the French Air Force for its missions in Afghanistan, Libya and Mali. Rafale can also carry more fuel and weapons than the J-20. Rafale can carry out at least four missions in one sortie while the J-20 cannot carry out multiple missions in one go.\n\n* Rafale vs Pakistan’s F16: 190-kg Meteor missile has a Beyond Visual Range (BVR) of over 100 km, travelling at a top speed of Mach 4. The F-16 jets, used by Pakistan, carry the AMRAAM missile, which has a BVR of 75 km. Rafale can also outperform F16 in dogfights. PAF will have to deploy two F16s to counter one Rafale.\n\n* Can be deployed in Ladakh: The Indian Air Force could deploy the first batch of Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector, amid ongoing tension on the border with China.\n\nDetails of how it will bring changes in the IAF:\n\n* More Advanced Technology: The Rafales are armed with 'Meteor' air-to-air missiles (120-150 km strike range), 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles (over 300 km) and other armaments. The Meteor missiles are arguably the best in the world for air combat duels, with “a greater no-escape zone” for hostile fighters than any comparable BVR (beyond visual range) weapon. Pakistan and China do not currently have any missiles of this class in their combat inventories.\n\n* Combat Proven: With more than 30,000 flight hours in operations, it has proven its worth in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria. On the other hand, Pakistan JF-17 and Chengdu J-20 are yet to be tested in battles or war-like situations.\n\n* IAF's lack of long-range weapons over: For almost two decades, the IAF has been perceived to be handicapped on long-range weapons and sensors vis-a-vis PAF. Rafale will reverse this and give IAF the decisive edge with better sensors and weapons. Each Rafale in the air would require at least two F16s for a counter-challenge.\n\n* Edge over rivals: The Rafale fighters will be able to outgun and outrun Pakistani F-16 and JF-17 as well as the Chinese Chengdu J-20 fighters. According to sources, the air-to-air and the air-to-ground strike capabilities of Rafales cannot be matched by either China or Pakistan and the aircraft would give India an edge over both the rivals.\n\n* Air superiority: The state-of-the-art 4.5 Generation Rafale jet can reach almost double the speed of sound, with a top speed of 1.8 Mach. With its multi-role capabilities, including electronic warfare, air defence, ground support and in-depth strikes, the Rafale lends air superiority to the Indian Air Force.\n\n* Enhance offensive capabilities of IAF: The jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions--ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. The Rafale will be the seventh addition to the types of fighters that the IAF has--a feat very unique to the force in comparison to major air forces in the world.\n\n* Can shoot down enemy targets without crossing border: Rafale jet will be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft, even if over 100 km away, without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\n* Omnirole (ability to perform multiple mission types simultaneously): The jet is capable of performing several actions at the same time, such as firing air-to-air missiles during a very low altitude penetration phase, giving it outstanding survivability.\n\n* Can avoid being tracked by Pakistan: The multi-role combat aircraft, reportedly, has a range of between 780-1055 km compared to the 400-550 km of the Su 30 MKI. This means that India will now be able to engage Pakistani aircraft from larger distances, without the risk of being tracked.\n\n* All-weather capability: Meteor provides the all-weather capability to engage a wide variety of targets from fast jets to small unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles.\n\n* Pre-planned attacks can be averted: The Scalp is an air-launched long-range deep strike missile, designed to deal with pre-planned attacks against high value fixed or stationary targets.\n\n* Capability to take out any bunkers: The HAMMERs would give India the capability to take out any bunkers or hardened shelters in any type of terrain including the mountainous locations such as Eastern Ladakh.\n\n* Will make IAF stronger: The aircraft has very good flying performance and its weapons, radar and other sensors and Electronic Warfare capabilities are amongst the best in the world.\n\n* Quick reaction deployment in high altitude possible: Specially tailored for the IAF, the Rafale jets have cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh.","title":"How Rafale fighters give IAF massive edge over China and Pakistan: Explained","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1596031343000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/india/how-rafale-fighters-give-iaf-massive-edge-over-china-and-pakistan-2299363.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/07/29/875720-rafale-970-a.jpg"}

The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nThe final legal judgement on the controversy was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2019. It dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.[1] The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.[2][3] In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crore).[4] In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints.[5] In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture.[6] After the Indian general election in April–May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress.\n\nAs disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale.[7][8][9] Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable.[10] In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid.[11] On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO Éric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \"95 percent completed\".[12]\n\nDuring an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \"critical operational necessity\".[13] In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun.[14] In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition.[15] In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of €7.87 billion (₹58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to €11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and €8.6 billion quoted in January 2016.[16] Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%.[17]\n\nIn September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.[16] According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package.[18] It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of €91.1 million (₹681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of €94 million (₹703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of €1.8 billion (₹13,470 crore), a weapons package costing €710 million (₹5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of €353 million (₹2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground cruise missile.[19] The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers.[20]\n\nThe agreement included a 50% \"offset clause\", which required the companies involved in the agreement—primarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA—to invest 50% of the contract value (approximately €3.9 billion or ₹30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately €1.2 billion or ₹9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).[18][21] Of this 50%, 74% (approximately €2.9 billion or ₹22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers.[22]\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\" (IDDM) initiative.[23] Dassault intended to invest in excess of €100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations.[24] The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018.[25]. Despite having zero experience in aircraft part production, when Reliance Group was chosen as a partner instead of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, doubts were raised based on closeness of Ambani family with prime minster Narendra Modi[26].\n\nAllegations [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of price escalation [ edit ]\n\nThe day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹715 crore to ₹1,600 crore.[27] A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ₹670 crore.[28][29] In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹526.1 crore to ₹1,570 crore.[30] Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements.[31][32] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender.[33] French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures.[34]\n\nIn an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables.[35]\n\nAllegations of favouritism [ edit ]\n\nModi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones.\n\nIn November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault.[36]\n\nAnil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo-French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%.[30] Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn.[37]\n\nDefence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies.[31] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO.[38] French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total.[34]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nWhile campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack prime minister Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited.[39][40] Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder.[41]\n\nIn December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force.[42][43]\n\n2018 budget session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA.[44] Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam.[45] Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered.[46] In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012.[47][48] Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total.[49] Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals.[50] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public.[51] Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation.[52]\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken.[53]\n\nIndia Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to €99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was €91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements.[54][55] The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ₹525 crore or €79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to €100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as €91.7 million for each aircraft, €1.8 billion for spare parts, €1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, €710 million for weapons and €353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%.[56]\n\nIn an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind.[57][58] A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018.[59]\n\nCongress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ₹1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ₹1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ₹351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security.[60] Dassault's CEO, Éric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals.[61] On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ₹670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\".[28][62]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government.[63] In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ₹45,000 crore was stolen and given to \"an industrialist friend\", referring to Anil Ambani.[64] In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ₹700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \"his friend's company\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited.[65] In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition.[66]\n\n2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ₹45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement.[67][68] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim.[69][70] Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments.[71] Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information.[72]\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was €79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to €100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the €91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper.[73] He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds.[74]\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016.[75] He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth ₹30,000 crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at ₹100,000 crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of ₹130,000 crore and termed it as a theft.[76][77] Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal.[78]\n\nRajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get ₹30,000 crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture—Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited—had 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived.[79]\n\nArun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of ₹1,000 crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations.[80][81] They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so.[82] The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision.[83]\n\nIn response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \"fully loaded\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year.[84][85] M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op-ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of ₹45,000 crore in a contract worth ₹58,000 crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at ₹538 crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to ₹737 crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of ₹670 crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to ₹2,023 crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth ₹30,000 crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of ₹45,000 crore from offsets.[86]\n\nAir Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale\n\nVice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy.[87] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts.[88] Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft.[89] Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal.[90]\n\nNirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational.[91] T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government.[92] Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying.[93] Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft.[94][95]\n\nCongress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal.[96] They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal.[97] Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee.[98] Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.[99] Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \"political witch hunt\".[100] Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal.[101]\n\nQuoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre-existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015.[102] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get ₹30,000 crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only ₹6,500 crore.[103]\n\nReliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.[104]\n\nFrançois Hollande [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France François Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing.[105] When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact.[106] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \"full freedom\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too.[107][108][109] Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance.[110] Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault.[111][112] Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down.[113]\n\nSupreme Court writ petition [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption.[114] Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court.[115] On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October.[116]\n\nOn 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner.[117][118][120] In its ruling, the court said it has \"studied the material carefully\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing.[118] It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government.[118][121] It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement.[118] \"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime’s) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\".[118] It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package.[118] \"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\" the court said.[118][121]\n\nOn the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material.[118][122] \"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\" the court said.[122] The court said \"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\" adding that the \"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\"[123]\n\nChief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\"[124]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nNotwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\"[125] The Indian government promptly rejected the demand.[126] Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal.[127] Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order.[127] Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report.[127]\n\nThe ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed.[128] Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\".[129]\n\nThe petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\"[130] adding that \"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\".[130] While claiming that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\" the trio accused the court of taking a \"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\"[130][131] The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \"full public disclosure of all the facts\" along with \"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\".[131]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \"sharp attack\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\".[132] The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \"expose\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal.[133][clarification needed]\n\nSamajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \"is supreme in the eyes of people\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\" he said.[134] Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC.[135]\n\nPlea for corrections in verdict [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections.[136] The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\"[137][138] By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain.[137] The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report.[137] The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter.[137][139]\n\nOn 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \"self-contradictory\"[140] and to issue notices to the government for \"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\"[141][139] The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\".[139]\n\nThe Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January,[138] along with a review petition from the petitioners.[138][needs update]\n\nFinal Supreme Court judgement [ edit ]\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict from 14 December 2018 on the controversy. It upheld its the previous judgement stating that no irregularities or corruption were found in the deal.[142][143][144] The judgement has been seen with suspicion by some sections as the Chief Justice of India was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Bharatiya Janata Party government within months after his retirement, which was seen as possible quid-pro-quo for delivering a favourable judgement[145].\n\nSee also [ edit ]","title":"Rafale deal controversy","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Rafale_at_Aero_India_2017.jpg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b81"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale fighter India","text":"The Rafales are joining No. 17 Squadron “Golden Arrows” Squadron at Ambala. This is the first of at least two planned units that will fly the 36 Rafales that are currently on order as part of a €7.87-billion contract, or around $8.7 billion in U.S. dollars at the time, that was signed in 2016. All 36 aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2022 and they will be equally split with No. 101 “Falcons” Squadron, which will be re-established as the second Indian Rafale unit, based at Hashimara Air Force Station.\n\nThe delivery had been planned for May 2020, but it was slightly delayed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Rafales and their seven pilots were greeted by the Indian Air Force chief-of-staff, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on July 29. Their arrival marked the first new residents for the base since India’s first Jaguar fighter-bombers were delivered there, coincidentally, on a similar date of July 27, 1979.\n\nFive brand-new Indian Air Force Dassault Rafale fighters recently touched down at Ambala Air Force Station in Haryana, India. The aircraft had departed from Dassault Aviation’s Bordeaux-Mérignac facility in France two days prior and made the over 5,000-mile journey supported by French tanker aircraft, with a stop-off at Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Indian Air Force’s Rafales are built as F3-R-standard aircraft, but they come with some fascinating bespoke additions. A Dassault-owned, test-configured Rafale B with Indian-specific modifications started flying at Istres-Le Tubé in France in August 2018. It has progressively carried as many as 14 different Indian Air Force modifications to the baseline F3-R standard aircraft.\n\nThales The Thales Front Sector Optronics (FSO) system is said to have been heavily upgraded for the Indian Rafales.\n\nIndian Rafales feature an improved version of the Thales Front Sector Optronics (FSO) system, which includes SAGEM infra-red search-and-track (IRST). They also feature the Elbit Display and Sight Helmet (DASH), a modified radar altimeter for flying in mountainous terrain, plus a cold start engine capability for high-altitude airfield operations. They also include software modifications for the RBE2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. A new low-band podded jammer and a towed radar decoy are also being added, according to Angad Singh, an analyst at the Observer Research Foundation, in New Delhi. The additional Indian modifications are being added under a concurrent design, modification, test, and certification schedule. “Everything will be integrated and certified around the time the last jets are ready for delivery [in April 2022]. At which point modification kits will be shipped out and all jets will be brought up to the same specification,” Singh added.\n\nMBDA An MBDA diagram illustrating the Indian Rafale weapons package.\n\nThe weapons package that accompanies the Rafale procurement includes the MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM), both infre-red and radar-guided versions of the MICA Multi-Mission Air-to-Air Missiles, and the Scalp long-range cruise missile. Shortly before the delivery of the first five aircraft, it was announced that the Indian Air Force would also procure the Sagem HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range), also known as Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM), to meet an urgent operational requirement for the new Rafales amid a serious face-off against China. These weapons would be ideally suited to taking out buried targets in mountainous locations such as Eastern Ladakh. The Indian Air Force previously planned to integrate the Rafael SPICE (Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective) weapon on its Rafales in-country. According to Singh this weapon was selected on cost grounds, however, the pressing requirement has resulted in the Air Force opting for a ready-baked solution for the Rafale in HAMMER. The Rafale F3 variant is now France's primary nuclear-capable combat aircraft. The Indian Rafales are rumored to be similarly capable, but India has never confirmed if that capability exists in any of its fighter aircraft.\n\nDassault/Anthony Pecchi A Rafale with a full load of Meteor, HAMMER and MICA weapons.\n\nDassault/G. Gosset A concurrent development program will see India's 36 Rafales fully capable by 2022.\n\nIndia’s MMRCA project was set against the replacement of its aging MiG-21 Bisons and MiG-27s, the latter of which was retired at the end of 2019. An initial competition included the Rafale, along with the Eurofighter, Gripen, F-16, MiG-35, and Super Hornet. India shortlisted the Rafale and the Eurofighter in April 2011, and after a long and exhaustive evaluation process, the French fighter was declared the winner on January 31 the following year. MMRCA was set as a 126-aircraft requirement, and it mandated that 108 jets should be built locally by HAL. However, after several rounds of negotiations, the MMRCA program broke down in April 2015. Instead, India said it would purchase 36 Rafales under a government-to-government contract, but with no local production. A contract for 36 Rafales was signed in New Delhi on September 23, 2016, and it included a possible follow-on sale of 36 additional aircraft. The initial batch includes 28 single-seat Rafale EH models and eight two-seat DHs. France has proved a reliable partner for India, having participated in a number of fighter projects, including the supply of Mirage 2000 fighters. Dassault is also currently supporting a comprehensive upgrade effort for India’s Mirages.\n\nDassault/G. Gosset A two-seat Indian Rafale DH.\n\nFirst Indian Rafale to fly was DH serial RB008, which made its maiden flight on October 30, 2018, from Bordeaux-Mérignac. This aircraft is supporting the test and certification of the India-specific enhancements. Rafale DH serial RB001 followed by making its first flight at Mérignac on July 17, 2019. This two-seater was formally handed over to the Indian government on October 8, 2019, at an event hosted by Dassault chairman and CEO Eric Trappier with guests including India’s defense minister Shri Rajnath Singh. With MMRCA abandoned and at least 36 Rafales on order, India has now launched yet another fighter tender. On April 6, 2018, it issued a Request for Information (RFI) for “approximately 110 aircraft,” roughly one quarter of which it said should be two-seaters. New Delhi specified that no more than 15% of the jets would be manufactured by the winning manufacturer, with the balance being built locally under the “Make in India” initiative. The key points of the RFI include an openness for single and twin-engine jets, a requirement for air superiority missions at 20,000ft (6,096m), low-level ingress, strike and egress at 492ft [150m]) and anti-shipping capabilities have been mandated. In addition to an option for more Rafales, Boeing is set to offer either the Advanced F-15 or Block III Super Hornet, with Lockheed Martin touting a tailored F-16 design dubbed the F-21. In addition are the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Saab JAS 39 Gripen E, the MiG-35 “Fulcrum,” and the Su-35 “Flanker.”\n\nIndian Air Force A Rafale EH receives fuel during the transit flight to France France to India.\n\nThe Indian Navy too is searching for a new fighter now that the naval variant of HAL’s LCA has been deemed unsuitable for carrier operations. The Navy says it wants a powerful twin-engine fighter that would ultimately replace its MiG-29Ks. This puts both the Rafale and the Super Hornet squarely in the running, with eyes on potential synergies with the Indian Air Force’s new fighters. The reaction to the first Rafales arriving at Ambala speaks volumes about a national perspective on the pressing need to recapitalize an ageing fighter fleet of MiG-21s, which is set against the backdrop of pressure from both China and Pakistan. The arrival of five fighters is just the first stage of a potentially huge influx of new fighters to India, which will operate from both land and sea, in the years to come. With a host of exotic optional extras added to its Rafales by the spring of 2022, the French replacement for tired Russian MiGs is shaping up to be very impressive indeed.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2736c4ca1f45bbe20e7b83"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale fighter India","text":"Multi-role combat aircraft family by Dassault\n\nThe Dassault Rafale ( French pronunciation: ​ [ʁafal], literally meaning \"gust of wind\",[9] and \"burst of fire\" in a more military sense)[10] is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \"omnirole\" aircraft by Dassault.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.\n\nMany of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.\n\nIntroduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and Navy (Marine Nationale) had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service.[11] Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal.[12] In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller Dassault Mirage 2000, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles.[13]\n\nIn 1979, the French company Dassault joined the MBB/BAe \"European Collaborative Fighter\" (ECA) project which was renamed the \"European Combat Aircraft\".[14] The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin-engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country.[13] In 1983, the \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.[15]\n\nA number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new EFA programme.[11][N 1] In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project.[17][18] Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon.[19]\n\nDesign phase and prototype\n\nIn France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The French Ministry of Defence required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground, all-day and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's airframe, avionics, propulsion system and armament, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the French Armed Forces. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the Jaguar, Mirage F1C/CR/CT, Mirage 2000C/-5/N in the Armée de l'air, and the F-8P Crusader, Étendard IVP/M and Super Étendard in the Aéronavale.[11][20]\n\nDuring October–December 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning \"Tactical Combat Airplane\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace (meaning \"Bird of Prey\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin.[13] In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a technology demonstrator named Avion de Combat expérimental (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.[13][21]\n\nThe Dassault \"Rafale A\" technology demonstrator in 2006\n\nThe resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system.[11] Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the DGA, France's defence procurement agency.[13] The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in Saint-Cloud, and took its maiden flight on 4 July 1986 from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in southern France.[11] During the one-hour flight, the project's chief test pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of 11,000 metres (36,000 ft) and a speed of Mach 1.3. The 9.5-tonne (21,000 lb) demonstrator stopped in 300 metres (980 ft) upon landing.[22]\n\nThroughout the flight test programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers Clemenceau and Foch to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of Mach 2 (2,450 km/h; 1,520 mph; 1,320 kn) and a height of 13,000 metres (42,000 ft).[23] The demonstrator was initially powered by General Electric F404-GE-400 afterburning turbofans from the F/A-18 Hornet, instead of the Snecma M88, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme.[11][24] It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach 1.4 and demonstrate supercruise, or sustained supersonic flight without use of afterburners. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.[11][23][25]\n\nAt the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac declared that the country would proceed with the US$30 billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996.[26][27][28][29] However, the fall of the Berlin Wall, which signalled the end of the Cold War, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million.[30][31] This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.[11][32][33]\n\nRafale logo\n\nDuring the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging F-8 Crusader, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \"interoperability testing\" aboard the French aircraft carrier Foch. The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.[34][35]\n\nTesting\n\nA two-seater Rafale B during aerial refueling\n\nTo meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \"Rafale C\" (chasseur, meaning \"fighter\" or literally \"hunter\") and the \"Rafale B\" (biplace, or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, man-machine interface and weapons, and expand the flight envelope.[36] Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.[37]\n\nThe C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight.[38] The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993.[36] It was 350 kilograms (770 lb) heavier than the single-seater, but carried 400 litres (110 US gal) less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two 2,000-litre (530 US gal) external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.[39]\n\nA French Navy Rafale M with tail hook deployed during landing aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing Étendard IV Ms & Ps, F-8P Crusaders and Super Étendard Modernisés. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long-term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993.[36][40] Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July–August 1992 and early the following year, at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier Foch in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerhervé, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993.[41]\n\nProduction and upgrades\n\nInitially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the Gulf War showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and reconnaissance missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet.[42] The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \"A\" and 139 \"B\" models\",[40][43] and later to 212 aircraft.[42] The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts.[40][42] Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns,[43] though the two-seater was later cancelled.[23]\n\nProduction of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007.[42] A further order of 59 F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004.[44] In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180.[45]\n\nDuring the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of Dassault Systèmes' CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional computer-aided design, manufacture and engineering software suite that would become standard across the industry.[46] CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as digital mockup and product data management. It consisted of 15 GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support.[46]\n\nThe Rafale final assembly site is located adjacent to Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport\n\nAccording to the French magazine L'Usine nouvelle, apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport. For example, the flight control surfaces are fabricated in Haute-Savoie, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in Val-d'Oise, and the engines in Essonne.[47] Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, Thales and Safran, who rely on a network of 500 subcontractors. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. As of 2012 , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft.[47]\n\nDeliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999.[48] Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board Charles de Gaulle; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the Gulf of Oman, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations.[49] In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training.[40]\n\nThe total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around €45.9 billion,[8] which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately €160.5 million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation.[50] The unit flyaway price as of 2010 was €101.1 million for the F3+ version.[51]\n\nIn 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch miniaturised satellites.[52] In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser-targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity.[53] In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced.[54][55]\n\nIn January 2014, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that €1 billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018.[56][57] The Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later,[58] until replacement by the Franco-German New Generation Fighter.\n\nFuture replacement\n\nIn 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the New Generation Fighter. This fighter aircraft under development by Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence and Space, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2035-40 timeframe.[59]\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with active close-coupled canard to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from −3.6g to 9g (10.5g on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11g can be reached in case of emergency[60][61]). The Rafale is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft and uses digital fly-by-wire flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability.[61][N 2] The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to 115 knots (213 km/h; 132 mph); while in flight, airspeeds as low as 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) have been observed during training missions.[61] According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications.[63]\n\nThe Rafale M features a greatly reinforced undercarriage to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an arrestor hook, and \"jump strut\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including catapult launches.[36] It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based microwave landing system, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the inertial navigation system to external equipment.[39] Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) compared to other variants.[41] The Rafale M retains about 95 percent commonality with Air Force variants including,[64] although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of Charles de Gaulle, France's first nuclear-powered carrier, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, Foch and Clemenceau.[39]\n\nRadar signature\n\nS-duct air intake conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS\n\nAlthough not a full-aspect stealth aircraft, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature .[65][66] In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail-fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine air inlets underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of composite materials and serrated patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards.[58][65] Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite.[67] Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified.[62]\n\nCockpit\n\nThe Rafale's glass cockpit was designed around the principle of data fusion—a central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control.[68] The primary flight controls are arranged in a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed side-stick controller and a left-handed throttle.[69] The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29° to improve g-force tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view.[70] An intelligent flight suit worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.[71]\n\nGreat emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations.[62] Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls.[69] Developed by Crouzet, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and countermeasures systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions.[72] For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.[73]\n\nFor displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment.[74] Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of human–computer interaction (HCI).[13] A head-mounted display (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles.[69][75][76] The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG).[69]\n\nIn the area of life support, the Rafale is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mark 16F \"zero-zero\" ejection seat, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board oxygen generating system, developed by Air Liquide, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters.[77] The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The auto-pilot and autothrottle controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls.[69]\n\nAvionics and equipment\n\nThe Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface.[62][N 3] The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self-protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft.[78] The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters,[79] and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the Airbus A380.[80] According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life.[62]\n\nAnnotated diagram of SPECTRA 's elements\n\nThe Rafale features an integrated defensive-aids system named SPECTRA, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and MBDA.[81] Various methods of detection, jamming, and decoying have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub-systems in the future.[82][N 4] Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) platforms.[83]\n\nThe Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods,[84] such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod.[78] Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot.[85] Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a FLIR.[85]\n\nThe Damocles designation pod was described as \"lacking competitiveness\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods;[86] so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds.[87] A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show[88] and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018.[89] Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms.[90][N 5] Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.[85]\n\nRadar and sensors\n\nThe Rafale was first outfitted with the Thales RBE2 passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain-following and the real-time generation of high resolution ground maps for navigation and targeting.[91] In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months.[66] In September 2006, Flight International reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range.[92]\n\nThe RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200 km,[93] improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar.[94] A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway.[90] In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \"on time and on budget\").[94] By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013.[95]\n\nTo enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or Optronique Secteur Frontal (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and infrared wavelengths.[96] The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the MICA at beyond visual range distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea.[97] Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance.[91] In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally.[94]\n\nArmament and standards\n\nInitial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the F1 (\"France 1\") standard, these had been equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations.[98] Later deliveries were to the \"F2\" standard, which added the capability for conducting both air-to-ground and reconnaissance operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006.[99] Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s.[69][76]\n\nWeapons of the Rafale\n\nF3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air-to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using SCALP EG cruise missiles and AASM Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 Exocet sea skimming missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with ASMP-A missiles.[100] In 2010, France ordered 200 MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service.[101][102]\n\nThe F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.[103]\n\nFor compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with MIL-STD-1760, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment.[62] The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 hardpoints (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30 mm GIAT 30 revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions.[62] According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility.[62]\n\nEngines\n\nCloseup of the rear of the airframe and the two engine nozzles\n\nRafale B in a clean configuration\n\nThe Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to 50 kilonewtons (11,000 pounds-force) of dry thrust and 75 kN (17,000 lb f ) with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures.[62] The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.[104][105]\n\nQualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year.[106] Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine.[11][107] In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2.[108] The engine is of a modular design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard.[106] There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[109] As of 2007, a thrust vectoring variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development.[98]\n\nOperational history\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Naval Aviation\n\nIn December 2000, the French Naval Aviation (Aéronavale), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron Flottille 12F, which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale.[110] Flottille 12F immediately participated in Trident d'Or aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with warships from ten other nations. During the maritime exercise, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings.[110][111] After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004.[112]\n\nThe Rafale M is fully compatible with US Navy aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks.[113] On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on USS Harry S. Truman, a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier.[114]\n\nIn 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard Charles de Gaulle of the French Navy during \"Mission Héraclès\", the French participation in \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while Charles de Gaulle was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India-Pakistan border.[13][115]\n\nIn 2016, Rafales operating from Charles de Gaulle struck targets associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[116]\n\nIn December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while Charles de Gaulle undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions.[117] Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and 17F, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard USS George H.W. Bush for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at Naval Air Station Oceana.[118]\n\nFrench Air Force\n\nFormation of five Rafales making a flypast in 2006\n\nRafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that Escadron de Chasse (Fighter Squadron) 1/7 at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8–10 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when EC 1/7 would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters).[112][119]\n\nIn 2007, after a \"crash program\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to Dushanbe in Tajikistan, while the three others were Rafale Marine of the Navy on board Charles De Gaulle.[120] The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first GBU-12 was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational début of the Rafale.[121] Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at Kandahar International Airport to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces.[122]\n\nOn 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and strike missions over Libya in Opération Harmattan, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of Benghazi.[123] The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead.[83] On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway.[124]\n\nDuring the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \"Hammer\" bombs, a Thales Damoclès targeting pod and two drop tanks;[83] these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft.[125] The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between 125 kilograms (280 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions.[125] Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow SCALP weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra.[126] In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground-attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the close air support role.[125]\n\nA French Air Force Rafale B during Operation Serval in Mali, 2013\n\nIn January 2013, the Rafale took part in \"Opération Serval\", the French military intervention in support to the government of Mali against the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa.[127] The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of Gao, eastern Mali.[128] Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from Timbuktu and Douentza.[129] Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali.[130]\n\nIn August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall.[131]\n\nIn September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of Opération Chammal, France's contribution to the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[132][133] On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zummar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.[134][135]\n\nIn April 2018, during the Syrian Civil War, five Rafale B fighters from the Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Each jet was loaded with two SCALP EG missiles.[136]\n\nEgypt\n\nIn November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement.[137] By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the Suez Canal expansion in August 2015.[138]\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales,[139] as part of a larger deal, including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and missiles, worth US$5.9 billion (€5.2 billion).[140][141] The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in Istres.[142] In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters.[143] All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force.[144] Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single-seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the Egyptian Air Force.[145] Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017.[146] The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales.[147]\n\nIn June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract.[148][149] An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations.[150]\n\nQatar\n\nA Qatari Rafale at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in 2019.\n\nStarting in 2011, the Qatar Emiri Air Force evaluated the Rafale alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Boeing F-15E, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace its Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales.[151] On 30 April 2015, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani announced to French President François Hollande that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft.[152] On 4 May, a €6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as €263M for each aircraft.[153][154] On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for €1.1 billion (or €92M each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters.[155] The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019.[156][157]\n\nIndia\n\nRafale of the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale.[158] In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs.[159] In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4 billion contract.[160] On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder.[161][162] It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under transfer of technology agreements.[163][164] The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion.[165][166]\n\nThe deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The Indian Defence Ministry instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft.[167][168] In May 2013, The Times of India reported that negotiations were \"back on track\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017.[169] Another point of contention was a provision where Dassault was to reinvest 50 percent of the deal's earnings into India's defence sectors, either through purchases or technological expertise.[170][171] In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL.[172] By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015.[173]\n\nA Rafale landing at Ambala Air Force Station on its first arrival in India on 29 July 2020.\n\nIn April 2015, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris, India requested the rapid delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition.[174][175] Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years.[176] India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015.[177] Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities.[178] In January 2016, the Indian government directed the Indian Navy to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters.[179] Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales.[180] On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a €7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price.[181] The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years.[182] The deal includes weapons and spares, which included Meteor BVRAAM missiles.[183][184] India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China.[185]\n\nThe Indian National Congress raised an issue over Dassault partnering with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence, now known as Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited(R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner; Gandhi alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence.[186][187] Party spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹7.15 billion to ₹16 billion.[188] In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the Supreme Court for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal.[189][190]\n\nIn March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing MiG-21s and to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s.[191] Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart; it had tail number \"RB-001\" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal.[192]\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.[193]\n\nDelivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Airforce from France.[194]\n\nPotential operators\n\nAnalysts view the relatively quick series of 84[195] orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the Arab Spring and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East.[196]\n\nFinland\n\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[197]\n\nIn December 2015 Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the United States where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program.[198] The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.[199]\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) Mikoyan MiG-29, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[200] In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region.[201][202]\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs.[203] A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated.[204] Although a leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds,[N 6] on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs.[206] Due to a referendum, this purchase never happened.\n\nIn March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35.[207][208] In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons.[209] In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at Payerne Air Base for comparison against other bids.[210]\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nIn 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles.[211] In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed.[212] However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Union Defence Force, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in November 2011 called the French offer \"uncompetitive and unworkable\";[213] France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6 billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale.[214] Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon[215] or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[216]\n\nThe newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait.[217] In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit.[218] In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft.[219] In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s.[220] In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales.[221] In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE.[222]\n\nOthers\n\nSpain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.[223]\n\nIn January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its air force.[224]\n\nFailed bids\n\nThe Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100 million (2010),[225] while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour.[226] The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate.[226] According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.[227]\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance offered economic and technology partnerships in its bid for the Rafale to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters starting in 2023 as part of the air combat capability successor program. Other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35.[228] On 25 October 2018, Belgium selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace around 54 F-16s; government officials stated that the decision came down to price and that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven valuation criteria\"; the total purchasing price for the aircraft and support until 2030 totaled €4 billion, €600 million cheaper than the initial budget of €4.6 billion.[229][230]\n\nBrazil\n\nIn June 2008, the Brazilian Air Force issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, Su-35, Gripen NG and Eurofighter Typhoon.[231] In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2 – Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F.[232] On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs.[233][234] In February 2011, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18.[235] After delays due to budget constraints,[236] in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5 billion deal to equip the air force.[237]\n\nCanada\n\nThe Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fleet.[238] In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions.[239] In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002.[240][241] In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin.[242] In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition.[243] Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35.[244] In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs.[245][246] In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.[247][248]\n\nKuwait\n\nIn February 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales.[249] In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms.[250] Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests.[251] In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18–22 Rafales.[252] However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons.[253][254]\n\nLibya\n\nIn January 2007, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24 billion\".[255] In December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi declared Libya's interest in the Rafale,[256] but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international military intervention during the 2011 Libyan civil war.[257]\n\nSingapore\n\nIn 2005, the Republic of Singapore Air Force embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. A number of options were considered and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two – Dassault Rafale and the F-15SG Strike Eagle. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft.[258] According to Defense Industry Daily, one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration.[259]\n\nOthers\n\nIn 2002, the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F-15K Slam Eagle over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft F-X Phase 1 fighter competition.[260]\n\nDuring 2006, while there was potentially trouble with Anglo-American negotiations over the F-35 Lightning II, there was talk of purchasing the Rafale M for Britain's Royal Navy.[261] However, in May 2012, after having abandoned the F-35B STOVL version in favour of the F-35C CATOBAR variant in October 2010, the UK reverted to purchasing the F-35B.[262][263]\n\nIn late 2007, La Tribune reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead.[264][265] While French Defense Minister Herve Morin labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations.[265][266]\n\nIn February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of SEPECAT Jaguars.[267] In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons.[268][269]\n\nVariants\n\nRafale B/C and M\n\nRafale A Technology demonstrator, first flew in 1986.[11] Rafale D Dassault used this designation (D for discrète) in the early 1990s to emphasise the new semi-stealthy design features.[270] Rafale B F3-R Two-seater version for the French Air Force.[36] \"It can operate with the Talios targeting pod (45 ordered by French army will delivered between 2019 and 2023).\"[271] Rafale C F3-R Same as Rafale B F3-R but Single-seat version for the French Air Force.[36] Rafale M F3-R Same as Rafale C F3-R but Carrier-borne version for the French Naval Aviation, which entered service in 2001. For carrier operations, the M model has a strengthened airframe, longer nose gear leg to provide a more nose-up attitude, larger tailhook between the engines, and a built-in boarding ladder. Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg (1,100 lb) more than the Rafale C.[36][272] It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise.[273] Rafale N Originally called the Rafale BM, was a planned missile-only two-seater version for the Aéronavale.[49] Budgetary and technical constraints have been cited as grounds for its cancellation.[23] Rafale R Proposed reconnaissance-oriented variant.[65] Rafale DM Two-seater version for the Egyptian Air Force.[274] Rafale EM Single-seat version for the Egyptian Air Force.[275] Rafale DH Two-seater version for the Indian Air Force.[276] Rafale EH Single-seat version for the Indian Air Force.[6] Rafale B, C, M F4 ( first step 4.1, second step 4.2) It will upgrade radar (F4.1), as well as improved capabilities in the Helmet-Mounted Display and AASM 1000 kg, OSF (long range optoelectronics system) will be receive an IRST( Infrared Search and Track ) for detecting and identifying airborne stealth targets at long range (F4.1), it will be more effective in network-centric warfare, more data exchange and satellite communication and will launch small (F4.2) . It as be ordered in 2019.:All 180 French Rafale B,C,M will be upgraded to F4.1 in 2022 and F4.2 in 2027,[271][277] moreover a further 30 aircraft at the full F4 standard (F4.2) will be ordered in 2023 and delivered between 2027 and 2030.[278]\n\nOperators\n\nMap with Dassault Rafale operators in blue, with orders in cyan\n\nFrance A total of 180 have been ordered out of a planned 286, with an option for another 9.[76] Approximately 152 are confirmed to be delivered by 2018.[279][280] As of 2017 , 149 had been delivered. In 2018 three Rafale will be delivered, and then in 2024 all the 28 remaining out of the 180 ordered will be delivered.[276][281][282]\n\nEgyptian Air Force – 24 Rafales in service of the 24 ordered as of December 2018.[147][286]\n\nQatar Air Force – Qatar ordered 24 of the fighters in 2015, adding 12 more in 2018. It also has an option to buy 36 more.[290] As of February 2020, 23 were delivered.[291]\n\nNotable accidents\n\nOn 6 December 2007, a French Air Force twin-seat Rafale crashed during a training flight. The pilot, who suffered from spatial disorientation, was killed in the accident. [292]\n\nOn 24 September 2009, after unarmed test flights, two French Navy Rafales returning to the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, collided in mid-air about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the town of Perpignan in southwest France. One test pilot, identified as François Duflot, was killed in the accident, while the other was rescued.[293]\n\nSpecifications\n\nAASM-Hammer family of weapons\n\nMICA: short- to medium-range air-to-air missile\n\nData from Dassault Aviation,[294] Superfighters,[295] French Navy,[296] International Directory of Military Aircraft[297]\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 1 or 2\n\n1 or 2 Length: 15.27 m (50 ft 1 in)\n\n15.27 m (50 ft 1 in) Wingspan: 10.90 m (35 ft 9 in)\n\n10.90 m (35 ft 9 in) Height: 5.34 m (17 ft 6 in)\n\n5.34 m (17 ft 6 in) Wing area: 45.7 m 2 (492 sq ft)\n\n45.7 m (492 sq ft) Empty weight: 10,300 kg (22,708 lb) (B)[69][294]\n\nGross weight: 15,000 kg (33,069 lb)\n\n15,000 kg (33,069 lb) Max takeoff weight: 24,500 kg (54,013 lb)\n\n24,500 kg (54,013 lb) Fuel capacity: 4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( C ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( B )\n\n4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( ) Maximum fuel: ( C ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) [ citation needed ]\n\n( ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) Powerplant: 2 × Snecma M88-2 turbofans, 50.04 kN (11,250 lbf) thrust each [298] dry, 75 kN (17,000 lbf) with afterburner\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 2,223 km/h (1,381 mph, 1,200 kn) [299] / Mach 1.8[300] at high altitude\n\n1,390 km/h, 860 mph, 750 kn / Mach 1.1 at low altitude\n\nSupercruise: [301] Mach 1.4 [ citation needed ]\n\nMach 1.4 Combat range: 1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs.\n\n1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs. Ferry range: 3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks\n\n3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks Service ceiling: 15,835 m (51,952 ft)\n\n15,835 m (51,952 ft) g limits: + 9 − 3.6 ( + 11 in emergencies) [60] [302] [303]\n\n9 3.6 ( 11 in emergencies) Rate of climb: 304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min)\n\n304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min) Wing loading: 328 kg/m 2 (67 lb/sq ft)\n\n328 kg/m (67 lb/sq ft) Thrust/weight: 0.988 (100% fuel, 2 EM A2A missile, 2 IR A2A missile) version B\n\nArmament\n\n\n\nAvionics\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nRelated lists\n\nNotes\n\n^ [16] Quote: \"Dassault demands design leadership as the price for European co-operation.\" ^ [62] Quote: \"Longitudinal stability is moderately negative with a full fly-by-wire digital control system.

Bullied by a menacing China, it must push every button, and then some.\n\nFresh, shiny new combat-ready Rafale fighter jets, sitting on the tarmac — why not send them up?\n\nMilitary strategists know that one good strafing by French-made Rafale’s toting Meteor missiles in the Ladakh sector would end China’s occupation in minutes — but who wants to start a war of attrition?\n\nFact is, the Indian Air Force could deploy its new Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, according to an official familiar with developments, the Hindustan Times reported.\n\nIndian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process, the official said on Sunday, ahead of a key IAF commanders’ meet this week.\n\nThe stumbling government of Chinese President Xi Jinping seems intent on destroying any goodwill in the region, a situation that will undoubtedly come at a cost.\n\nActing on a special request by the IAF, France is speeding up the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India and six jets are likely to land at their home base in Ambala on July 27 — instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch, the report said.\n\n“Air and ground crews have undergone full training on the aircraft including advanced weapons systems over the last one year in France,” said one of the officials cited above, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe IAF is looking at means to operationalise the Rafale in the quickest possible time and the new fighters could be deployed wherever there is a requirement including Ladakh, the report said.\n\nThe possible role of Rafale fighters could be discussed at the IAF commanders’ conference in New Delhi from July 22 to 24 where the air force brass is expected to focus on the ongoing border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made to stay prepared for any eventuality, said a second official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIndia-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases, the report said.\n\nIndia ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore (US$7.9 billion) in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.\n\nThe arrival of the Rafale will add punch to the IAF’s capability, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general at the Centre for Air Power Studies, the report said.\n\n“For sure, there will be a period of integration with other systems, and it (Rafale) would be put to use as the operational planners deem fit,” Bahadur said.\n\nAccording to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also being accelerated.\n\nIn the Ladakh sector, the IAF is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne regularly for demanding night-time missions from a forward base in the area, the report said.\n\nThe air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms undertaking night missions in the mountainous terrain.\n\nWeapons included beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 kilometers away, and the long-range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 kilometers away, according to The Print.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 kilometers away without even crossing Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-meter-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 kilometers in enemy territory.","title":"India could up the ante with new Rafale fighter jets","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1595182002000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://asiatimes.com/2020/07/india-could-up-the-ante-with-rafale-fighter-jets/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-19-at-11.43.55-AM.png?fit=1156%2C712&ssl=1"}

Certainly a game changer by all means, Rafale aircraft in the Indian Air Force will mean the country winning a prime place among the countries that boast of superior fighting aircrafts. When compared with the air power of Pakistan and many other South Asian countries, Rafale will lift up India’s competence significantly though comparing with China’s air strength will be a long way to go. Here are the top characteristics of Rafale that will explain why Rafale is different from Indian fighter aircrafts.For about twenty years, India has been viewed to be disadvantaged in terms of long-range arms and sensors vis-a-vis PAF. Rafale will change this fate and bestow on the IAF the crucial edge with far better weapons and sensors. Two F16s need to combine together to counter-challenge a single /Rafale in the air.Since the American Jets have superior radar and missiles, two Su 30MKI need to be knotted to fight one of PAK F16.The weapons package that Rafale will get for India will capacitate India with the ability to engage Pakistani jets from a long distance without the risk of being tracked. In addition, the air-to-ground SCALP missile can precisely track down any target on the Pakistani territory with ease. The precision long-range ground attack missile can attack the specific target accurately. Since Rafale has a range of more than 300 kms, Indian aircrafts will not need to cross the LOC since the operations similar to Balakot can be conducted from within the Indian airspace.Rafale features beyond visual range air to air missile that is the best today. The aircraft can take out the enemy aircraft from a range of more than 100 kms. There is no escape zone of more than 60 km, the missile can easily overtake those of the American origin.Already countries like France and Egypt have been operating Rafale jets, those that have been supplied to India are more sophisticated and highly customized to meet the specific needs that IAF has today.The pilots can significantly benefit from the helmet mounted sights and targeting systems and can shoot off the weapons with lightning speed.Rafale can easily take off from high altitude air bases like Leh on a cold start in order to carry out quick deployment AMRAAM presently with Pak in a highly accurate manner.The towed decoy system can thwart the incoming missile attacks.Upon the induction of Rafale into the IAF, France will provide industrial support for about 50 years.India has plans to acquire not less 36 more Rafale jets. The infrastructure necessary to accommodate them is now ready and a deal to purchase 36 more will cost the country considerably lesser since the specific enhancements required by India have been already paid for.","title":"What is special about the Rafale aircraft supplied to India?","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.in/defense/article/how-rafale-is-different-from-other-indian-fighter-aircrafts/articleshow/72051801.cms","image":"https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/72051801/how-rafale-is-different-from-other-indian-fighter-aircrafts.jpg?imgsize=86704"}

You have to set up a logistics chain, train technical and ground staff in India,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it usually takes up to two years before a new squadron is fully functional.

But rather than taking the deal forward, he surprised many by ordering 36 jets as part of a new deal in which HAL was not included.\n\nThe Indian government says it decided to buy the 36 jets in \"fly-away\" condition to quickly address the problem of the air force's depleting strength.\n\nBut it's not clear where India will procure the remaining aircraft it needs in the long run. The air force announced in 2018 that it would be seeking bids for around 110 more fighter jets, but the deal is yet to be finalised.","title":"Rafale: India gets new jets amid border tension with China","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53573878","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AC61/production/_113692144_iaf.jpg"}

It will have a halt for the night and next day fly to Ambala,” another source told ThePrint.\n\nThe initial plan was that the aircraft would arrive after layovers in multiple countries. However, the Covid pandemic meant that the pilots would have to undergo quarantine at each base, said the sources.\n\nIt has now been decided that two French Airbus mid-air refuellers will fly with the jets. There would be at least two rounds of mid-air refuelling on the way to UAE, the sources said.\n\nIndian mid-air refuellers will take charge the next day for the journey to Ambala. Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots are now getting trained in France for refuelling. This was not part of the original training, said the sources.\n\nFrance diverts missiles to IAF\n\nThe contract India and France signed in September 2016 had said the Rafale delivery would take place in May 2020, and the main weapons package would arrive in October, said the sources.\n\nHowever, following a request, France has diverted the missiles made for its air force to India. These have started arriving already.\n\nThese missiles include the beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 km away, and the long range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 km away.\n\n“This means that the Rafale could be combat-ready much earlier than expected. The Meteor and SCALP have already been integrated with the Rafales which are coming in,” another source said.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 km away without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-metre-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 km in enemy territory.\n\nAlso read: Kargil hero Col Wangchuk says need strong political will to strengthen India’s borders\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

Rafale fighter jets belong to the 4 ++ generation would not have been of much use had an aerial conflict broken out in Ladakh again the PLAAF.\n\nAs reported by EurAsian Times, India and China had been engaged in a brutal conflict in the Himalayan region of Ladakh. Troops of both countries have exchanged blows and even lost soldiers in the conflict that began more than a month ago.\n\nKeeping in mind the situation in Ladakh, France said that it would accelerate the delivery of Rafale fighter jets to India. Aviation experts believe that the arrival of Rafale fighter jets will significantly boost the combat capability of the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, according to Russian experts, who did not wish to be named, the French fighter would not help India much incase the conflict turns hot.\n\nThe astronomical cost of Rafale fighter jets is one of the reasons the French 4++ fighter jet would not help India. In the deal struck with Paris, New Delhi agreed to purchase 36 Rafale Jets. The total cost of the deal was an estimated Rs 59,000 crore with each jet costing around Rs 1,646 crore.\n\nThe cost of a Rafale is about three times higher than the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter jets. In other words, for 36 French-made Rafale fighters that will appear in the Indian Air Force, China can respond with three times as many of its fifth-generation J-20 fighters – for the same money.\n\nEven if, in some ways, the characteristics of the Chinese combat aircraft lag behind the French 4 ++ fighter jet, then the Indian air force could get overwhelmed by what is called “capable of crushing by quantity”.\n\nAnd the cost is not the only reason why Rafale jets would not help India much. Compared to another Chinese jet – J-16 (an analogue of the Russian Su-35) which Beijing is also using in its airforce, the Rafale jets will find it extremely challenging to outgun the Russian Su-35s operated by the Chinese.\n\nThe maximum speed of the Rafale jet is about Mach 1.8 and the J-16 is Mach 2.2. The Rafale’s practical ceiling is also lower than the J-16s. Even in engine thrust, the Chinese J-16s aka Russian Su-35s are far superior to the French combat aircraft.\n\nEven if the IAF was to deploy all 36 of its newly acquired jets, the technical superiority would still be on the side of China, claims the Russian expert.\n\nThe IAF has been on high alert in Ladakh and is closely monitoring all Chinese activity near the Line of Control. As reported by EurAsian Times, New Delhi has inked a deal with Moscow to buy 33 new fighter aircraft including 12 Su-30MKIs and 21 MiG-29s along with up-gradation of 59 MiG-29s. The addition and up-gradation of jets have been approved to strengthen India’s air power.\n\nThe air defence systems of both the Indian Army and the IAF have been deployed in Ladakh to prevent any misadventure by the Chinese Air Force fighter jets or the People’s Liberation Army choppers there.","title":"Indian Rafale Jets Would Have Been Useless Against Chinese Airforce – Russia Experts","author":["Eurasian Times Desk"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1594351330000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://eurasiantimes.com/indian-rafale-jets-would-have-been-useless-against-chinese-airforce-russia-experts/","image":"https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rafale-1.jpg"}

An IAF spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the development.\n\nHighlights The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence.\n\nIt can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard-points.\n\nThe two Rafale squadrons will be based at Ambala in Haryana and Hasimara in West Bengal, covering the western and eastern fronts.\n\nThe Indian fighters will be equipped with Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles built by European defence major MBDA Missile Systems.\n\nThe Meteor’s no-escape zone is touted to be three times greater than that of current medium range air-to-air missiles.\n\nIndia-specific enhancements on the jets include helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with enough storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.\n\nIndia ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.\n\n“We are aware that around 10 Rafale jets are ready at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility. Preparations are on to fly six Rafale jets to India in July-end with a stopover at Al Dhafra air base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The jets will be flown by Indian pilots,” said the second person cited above, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAll the 10 fighters are not being delivered in the first batch as some jets are needed in France to train IAF crews, he said.\n\nThe French air force will refuel the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra from where aerial refueling support is expected to be provided by the IAF’s Russian IL-78 refuellers, the second person said.\n\nExperts said accelerating the deliveries of Rafale jets was a significant development amid the ongoing border tensions with China.\n\n“It’s good that the Rafale delivery is being expedited as its operationalisation here would get advanced. Since we are in for the long haul on our northern borders, their availability with the IAF would add to its offensive potential,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.\n\nApart from the first batch, future deliveries of Rafale fighters are also being expedited, said the first person cited above.\n\nAccording to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022.\n\nFrance handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.\n\nThe IAF has raised its guard to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert. Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the United States --- in the region.\n\nThe IAF and the Indian Army have deployed their air defence systems in eastern Ladakh even as the PLA-Air Force has activated several of its bases in both Xinjiang and the Tibet Autonomous Region with Chinese fighter jets regularly making a show of strength in the Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday.\n\nBoth India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and missiles in the region that has garnered extensive global attention in recent weeks, particularly after the bloodshed along the LAC in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty. An unconfirmed number of Chinese troops were also killed in the Galwan Valley brawl.","title":"France speeds up Rafale fighter jet deliveries on IAF’s ‘special request’","author":["Rahul Singh"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1593419467000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-speeds-up-rafale-fighter-jet-deliveries-on-iaf-s-special-request/story-d52eideBabhi6BG9Nhmu5J.html","image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/06/29/Pictures/_a2c5b978-b9e2-11ea-8df8-49382d26f353.jpg"}

French defence companies have also forged lucrative collaborative ventures with Indian public sector undertakings to develop and manufacture a range of engines, to successfully power an assortment of locally designed helicopters.\n\n“The pragmatism, flexibility and professionalism of France’s defence trade practises have ensured their commercial success, not only with India, but with other countries as well over many years,” said a senior Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) official, declining to be named. The French government and their military vendors work in unison, he added, to ensure effective project completion, which is certainly not the case in India.\n\nAlso Read: As Rafale Fighter Jets Touch Down in Ambala, 5 Articles to Read on Questions About the Deal\n\nFlying under the radar\n\nFlying under the radar, several French defence vendors operating under Paris’ direction have frequently participated in classified Indian strategic programmes, one of which involved Dassault engineers quietly assisting the IAF in re-jigging its Mirage-2000H fighters to deliver precision guided munitions (PGMs) during the 1999 Kargil War.\n\nThis swiftly provided French support proved decisive in turning the tide of the 11-week long Kargil War, after the deadly PGMs blasted Pakistan Army bunkers in the Batalik and Drass heights, hastening the enemy’s withdrawal from Indian territory, back across the disputed line of control.\n\nThese precision Mirage strikes also created aviation warfare history, in that they were the first to have been executed in the world’s highest and most arduous terrain that is not only difficult to navigate but also highly challenging to effectively attack.\n\nEarlier, 1953 onwards France’s Dassault Aviation supplied India 100-odd M.D. 450 Ouragan (Hurricane) fighter-bombers-nicknamed Toofani by the IAF, followed by Mystere IVAs a few years later, that ably executed themselves in the 1965 war with Pakistan.\n\nThereafter, in July 1979, the IAF inducted the ground-attack SEPECAT Jaguars, built jointly by France’s Brequet and UK’s British Aircraft Corporation, of which the IAF still operates around 118, principally in a strategic role.\n\nAnd in a magnanimous gesture in July 2018 to an established customer, France gifted the IAF 31 Jaguar airframes to support the ageing platforms. The niggling UK, for its part, opted to sell the IAF two twin-seat Jaguar frames and 619 lines of rotables for Rs 28 million, when it could easily have followed France’s example and secured the IAF’s goodwill by supplying them free.\n\nSubsequently, in the mid-1980s Dassault was once again shortlisted to supply the IAF some three squadrons of around 51 single and dual-seat Mirage 2000H’s that presently constitute the force’s ‘sword’ arm. Currently, these platforms are being upgraded jointly by Dassault and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to Mirage 2000-5 levels, to provide the fighters greater lethality and agility and to extend their operational life by an additional 20-25 years.\n\nThese will be succeeded by the 36 Rafales, of which four will be twin-seat trainers. Dassault also remains in contention for the IAF’s putative tender for 114 medium multi-role fighters to make up depleting fighter squadron numbers that have sharply dropped from a sanctioned strength of 42 to 28 squadrons. Its maritime variant is also under consideration for the Indian Navy’s long-pending requirement for 57 carrier-based fighters.\n\nLicenced and indigenous productions\n\nIn the early 1960’s France also approved the licenced production of Chetak (Aerospatiale Alouette III) and Cheetah (Aerospatiale SA-315B Lama) light utility helicopters initially for the IAF, and later for the Army Aviation Corps after its formation in 1986.\n\nSix decades later, the upgraded versions of both helicopter types remain in service and continue to sustain army formations deployed in Himalayan regions, like the 17,000 feet high Siachen Glacier and surrounding areas. Both these helicopters also perform assorted training, transport, casualty evacuation, communications and liaison roles and limited interdiction tasks.\n\nIn 1961, France’s Turbomeca had granted HAL a manufacturing licence for its Artouste turboshaft engine to power the Chetak and Cheetah helicopters. Some 40 years later, this collaboration jointly developed the more powerful Shakti engine, whose variants power an assortment of locally designed and series built rotorcraft. These include the Dhruv advanced light helicopter, its combat variant Rudra and the under-development light utility helicopter, amongst others.\n\nEven the Russian Kamov Ka-226T ‘Hoodlum’ light multirole helicopter, of which India plans on indigenously licence building 140, is each powered by two French Turbomeca Arrius 2G engines. In short, France’s monopoly in supplying engines to power all of India’s indigenously developed or licence-built rotorcraft. is unrivalled.\n\nDefence analysts told The Wire that French ‘nimbleness’ had progressed indigenous engine development, a field in which India badly lacked technological expertise and proficiency, despite years of application. In comparison, other global engine makers were too hidebound to effect apposite collaborations.\n\nAnd, in 1983, India’s public sector Bharat Dynamics Limited began licence-building the French Milan anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), while in late 2005, India signed a $3.5 billion deal with France’s DCNS to build six Scorpene conventional diesel-electric submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited in Mumbai. The submarine Project-75 continues to be plagued by delays of over six years.\n\nAlso Read: ‘Atmanirbhar’ India’s Quest for Army Rifles Underlines Confusion in Procurement Policy\n\nJoint military exercises\n\nMeanwhile, Indian and French air forces and navies conduct joint exercises frequently, and in early 2018, the two sides signed a slew of agreements to augment bilateral strategic and defence ties. This included a logistics support pact to provide supplies and services to their respective militaries on ‘authorised’ port visits, joint conduct of exercises and during training.\n\nAt the time the two sides also concluded a confidentiality agreement, succeeding the one inked in 2008, restricting either side from divulging details of military purchases that included the import of 36 Rafale fighters which became a major political controversy during India’s 2019 general elections.\n\nBoth sides also decided to hold an annual dialogue between the two defence ministers to further enhance strategic and military ties, and concluded the Joint Strategic Vision of India-France Co-operation in the Indian Ocean Region to curb over-flights and the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the area, a thinly veiled measure aimed at China’s hegemonic designs.\n\nEarlier, in 2009, a 400-strong contingent of the Indian military participated in the Bastille Day parade for which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the guest of honour. This was the first time ever that Indian troops had taken part in another country’s national day parade.\n\nEven before, France – one of the P5 members of the UN Security Council – did not condemn India’s five underground nuclear tests in 1998 that were conducted by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Hindu nationalist BJP-led administration out of distrust of Chinese territorial ambitions. This support eventually stood Paris in good stead in the award of defence contracts later.\n\nAs the French saying goes, rien ne réussit comme le succès or nothing succeeds like success.","title":"Rafale Delivery Underlines France's 'Below Radar' Role as Key Source of Weapons for India","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://thewire.in/security/rafale-delivery-underlines-frances-below-radar-role-as-key-source-of-weapons-for-india","image":"https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/30084024/2020_7img29_Jul_2020_PTI29-07-2020_000165B-800x400.jpg"}

The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nThe final legal judgement on the controversy was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2019. It dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.[1] The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.[2][3] In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crore).[4] In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints.[5] In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture.[6] After the Indian general election in April–May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress.\n\nAs disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale.[7][8][9] Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable.[10] In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid.[11] On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO Éric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \"95 percent completed\".[12]\n\nDuring an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \"critical operational necessity\".[13] In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun.[14] In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition.[15] In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of €7.87 billion (₹58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to €11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and €8.6 billion quoted in January 2016.[16] Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%.[17]\n\nIn September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.[16] According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package.[18] It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of €91.1 million (₹681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of €94 million (₹703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of €1.8 billion (₹13,470 crore), a weapons package costing €710 million (₹5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of €353 million (₹2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground cruise missile.[19] The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers.[20]\n\nThe agreement included a 50% \"offset clause\", which required the companies involved in the agreement—primarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA—to invest 50% of the contract value (approximately €3.9 billion or ₹30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately €1.2 billion or ₹9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).[18][21] Of this 50%, 74% (approximately €2.9 billion or ₹22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers.[22]\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\" (IDDM) initiative.[23] Dassault intended to invest in excess of €100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations.[24] The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018.[25]. Despite having zero experience in aircraft part production, when Reliance Group was chosen as a partner instead of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, doubts were raised based on closeness of Ambani family with prime minster Narendra Modi[26].\n\nAllegations [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of price escalation [ edit ]\n\nThe day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹715 crore to ₹1,600 crore.[27] A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ₹670 crore.[28][29] In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹526.1 crore to ₹1,570 crore.[30] Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements.[31][32] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender.[33] French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures.[34]\n\nIn an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables.[35]\n\nAllegations of favouritism [ edit ]\n\nModi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones.\n\nIn November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault.[36]\n\nAnil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo-French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%.[30] Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn.[37]\n\nDefence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies.[31] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO.[38] French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total.[34]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nWhile campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack prime minister Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited.[39][40] Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder.[41]\n\nIn December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force.[42][43]\n\n2018 budget session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA.[44] Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam.[45] Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered.[46] In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012.[47][48] Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total.[49] Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals.[50] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public.[51] Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation.[52]\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken.[53]\n\nIndia Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to €99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was €91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements.[54][55] The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ₹525 crore or €79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to €100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as €91.7 million for each aircraft, €1.8 billion for spare parts, €1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, €710 million for weapons and €353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%.[56]\n\nIn an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind.[57][58] A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018.[59]\n\nCongress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ₹1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ₹1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ₹351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security.[60] Dassault's CEO, Éric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals.[61] On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ₹670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\".[28][62]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government.[63] In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ₹45,000 crore was stolen and given to \"an industrialist friend\", referring to Anil Ambani.[64] In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ₹700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \"his friend's company\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited.[65] In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition.[66]\n\n2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ₹45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement.[67][68] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim.[69][70] Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments.[71] Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information.[72]\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was €79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to €100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the €91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper.[73] He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds.[74]\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016.[75] He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth ₹30,000 crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at ₹100,000 crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of ₹130,000 crore and termed it as a theft.[76][77] Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal.[78]\n\nRajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get ₹30,000 crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture—Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited—had 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived.[79]\n\nArun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of ₹1,000 crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations.[80][81] They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so.[82] The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision.[83]\n\nIn response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \"fully loaded\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year.[84][85] M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op-ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of ₹45,000 crore in a contract worth ₹58,000 crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at ₹538 crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to ₹737 crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of ₹670 crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to ₹2,023 crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth ₹30,000 crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of ₹45,000 crore from offsets.[86]\n\nAir Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale\n\nVice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy.[87] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts.[88] Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft.[89] Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal.[90]\n\nNirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational.[91] T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government.[92] Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying.[93] Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft.[94][95]\n\nCongress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal.[96] They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal.[97] Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee.[98] Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.[99] Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \"political witch hunt\".[100] Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal.[101]\n\nQuoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre-existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015.[102] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get ₹30,000 crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only ₹6,500 crore.[103]\n\nReliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.[104]\n\nFrançois Hollande [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France François Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing.[105] When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact.[106] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \"full freedom\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too.[107][108][109] Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance.[110] Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault.[111][112] Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down.[113]\n\nSupreme Court writ petition [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption.[114] Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court.[115] On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October.[116]\n\nOn 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner.[117][118][120] In its ruling, the court said it has \"studied the material carefully\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing.[118] It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government.[118][121] It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement.[118] \"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime’s) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\".[118] It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package.[118] \"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\" the court said.[118][121]\n\nOn the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material.[118][122] \"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\" the court said.[122] The court said \"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\" adding that the \"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\"[123]\n\nChief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\"[124]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nNotwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\"[125] The Indian government promptly rejected the demand.[126] Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal.[127] Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order.[127] Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report.[127]\n\nThe ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed.[128] Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\".[129]\n\nThe petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\"[130] adding that \"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\".[130] While claiming that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\" the trio accused the court of taking a \"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\"[130][131] The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \"full public disclosure of all the facts\" along with \"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\".[131]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \"sharp attack\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\".[132] The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \"expose\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal.[133][clarification needed]\n\nSamajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \"is supreme in the eyes of people\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\" he said.[134] Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC.[135]\n\nPlea for corrections in verdict [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections.[136] The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\"[137][138] By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain.[137] The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report.[137] The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter.[137][139]\n\nOn 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \"self-contradictory\"[140] and to issue notices to the government for \"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\"[141][139] The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\".[139]\n\nThe Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January,[138] along with a review petition from the petitioners.[138][needs update]\n\nFinal Supreme Court judgement [ edit ]\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict from 14 December 2018 on the controversy. It upheld its the previous judgement stating that no irregularities or corruption were found in the deal.[142][143][144] The judgement has been seen with suspicion by some sections as the Chief Justice of India was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Bharatiya Janata Party government within months after his retirement, which was seen as possible quid-pro-quo for delivering a favourable judgement[145].\n\nSee also [ edit ]","title":"Rafale deal controversy","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Rafale_at_Aero_India_2017.jpg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854952"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale news india","text":"While India is celebrating the arrival of its Rafale jets, military experts have not only questioned its capabilities against US aircraft but also raised questions why the Rafale jets failed to compete in the international arms markets and got dumped by a majority of nations?\n\nDassault’s Rafale was not India’s only choice as various other global firms expressed interest in the MMRCA tender. Six renowned aircraft manufacturers competed to bag the contract of 126 jets, which was hailed to be the largest-ever defence acquisition deal of India.\n\nThe initial bidders were Lockheed Martin’s F-16s, Boeing’s F/A-18s, Eurofighter Typhoon, Russia’s MiG-35, Sweden’s Saab’s Gripen and Dassault’s Rafale.\n\nAll aircraft were tested by the IAF and after careful analysis on the bids, two of them — Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale — were shortlisted.\n\nDassault received the contract to provide 126 fighter jets as it was the lowest bidder and the aircraft was said to be easy to maintain. After Rafale won the contract, the Indian side and Dassault started negotiations in 2012. Though the initial plan was to buy 126 jets, India scaled it down to 36, that too in fly-away condition.\n\nNo Buyers For Rafale Jets?\n\nDespite boasting of awe-inspiring capabilities and selected by India after a mammoth testing & bidding process, the French origin jets didn’t see many buyers. Other than France and India, only Qatar and Egypt are using Rafale jets and that too in very limited numbers.\n\nAs reported earlier by EurAsian Times, Russian aviation experts had claimed that Rafale jets would have been useless against the Chinese Airforce (PLAAF). The maximum speed of the Rafale jet is about Mach 1.8 compared to Chinese J-16s at Mach 2.2. The Rafale’s practical ceiling is also lower than the J-16s. Even in engine thrust, the Chinese J-16s aka Russian Su-35s are far superior to the French combat aircraft. Even if the Indian Air Force (IAF) was to deploy all 36 of its newly acquired jets, the technical superiority would still be on the side of China, claimed the Russian expert.\n\nThe Rafale is one of the most expensive aircraft in the international market. India’s deal of 36 jets is worth Rs. 60,000 crores. Experts argue that the high cost is the result of many reasons including general inefficiency in the country’s defence sector, along with the small scale on which the Rafale is being produced in comparison to rival fighters such as the F-18, MiG-29 or F-35 due to which Rafale has not benefitted from economies of scale. This has contributed to its poor performance in the international markets.\n\nAnalysts believe that a major hindrance to the Rafale’s success is that it combines a high cost with a very light and unspecialised airframe, meaning that for countries seeking out a high-end fighter, they will turn to look towards something heavier and with more capabilities like the F-15 or Su-35, while for those seeking a cheap medium or lightweight fighter the F-16V, F-18E or MiG-35 would be more cost-effective.\n\nSouth Korea and Singapore selected the powerful F-15 over Rafale in the 2000s. In 2015, Egypt purchased 24 of those jets – with an option for 12 more – under a wider arms agreement with France.\n\nThe following year, in 2016, the two sides entered into a dialogue with Egypt possibly exercising that option, or even expanding the order up to 24 jets. However, even with high-level dialogue between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and French President Emmanuel Macron, Cairo and Paris didn’t finalise the deal. Instead, Egypt inked a deal with Russia to purchase “over two dozen” Su-35 fighter jets.\n\n“Indian media is celebrating the arrival of five Rafales as if they won a war against China. If Rafale is so good, why Oman, Korea, Singapore, Libya, Kuwait, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, UAE, Switzerland, Malaysia refused to buy it. Besides India, only Qatar & Egypt have bought it,” tweeted Ashok Swain, Professor of Peace and Conflict Research, UNESCO Chair of International Water Cooperation.\n\nRafale’s third buyer, India, previously proposed to acquire 126 jets under Make in India and not 36. However, it took five years for even the first five jets to arrive in India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it in April 2015 during his trip to France.\n\nAccording to Snehesh Alex Philip’s opinion piece in ThePrint, beneath the celebration of the arrival of Rafale jets, lies the harsh reality of India’s painfully slow defence purchases. The Rafale deal and a plethora of procurement, now being done under the emergency clause in the wake of tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), exposes the malaise that continues to shadow India’s defence procurement and planning. “Merely having a large standing Army or an Air Force with aircraft flying on an extended lease of life and without much use against modern weaponry of the enemy, cannot be India’s answer,” he wrote.\n\nAccording to analysts, despite heavy marketing by the makers of Rafale, France’s relatively small and inefficient defence sector seems to have met its limit with the fighter program. The small production lines are unable to produce the aircraft quickly or efficiently and the French budget for research and development is smaller in contrast to the US or Russia.\n\nThe aircraft is priced very steeply and most nations prefer to buy US jets not only because of the technical superiority but also to please the Americans instead of the French. The Rafales have seemingly lost the fight in the international market, despite boasting of excellent qualities.","title":"No Buyers For Rafale Jets: Why Almost Every Country Dumped French Rafales Except India?","author":["Eurasian Times Desk"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1596337462000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://eurasiantimes.com/no-buyers-for-rafale-jets-why-almost-every-country-dumped-french-rafales-except-india/","image":"https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rafale-1.jpg"}

We discussed matters of mutual concern including covid-19 situation, regional security and agreed to strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation between India and France,\" Singh said in a Twitter post.\n\nDassault Aviation had handed over the first of 36 Rafale aircraft, which India had ordered in 2016, during a visit by Singh to France last year. India was to get its first lot of four or five jets in May followed by one every month, but the covid-19 pandemic, which brought economic activities to a standstill and factories downing their shutters, delayed the delivery schedule.\n\nIndia had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around ₹58,000 crore.\n\nThe Rafale jet has been described as a “game changer\" for the Indian Air Force (IAF) as it significantly increases its capabilities. The jet comes equipped with a range of potent weapons including the European missile maker, MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile. The Meteor is a next generation missile that promises to revolutionise air-to-air combat and has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.\n\nBesides the missile systems, the Rafale jets will incorporate India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems.\n\nThe IAF has already completed its preparations to receive the aircraft in India, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots. The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala air force station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF.

Five of the 36 jets that were ordered have landed in India and more will be inducted in the IAF in the months to come.\n\nTheir landing at the Ambala Air Base Wednesday became a cause of celebration for the entire country, and rightly so. After all, it was the first induction of a full-fledged fighter aircraft in over 20 years.\n\nHowever, beneath this celebration lies the harsh reality of India’s painfully slow defence purchases. The Rafale deal and a plethora of procurement, now being done under the emergency clause in the wake of tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), exposes the malaise that continues to shadow India’s defence procurement and planning.\n\nThere is nothing to be proud of in the purchase of Rafales. The project to acquire the new generation fighter jets has taken 19 years to see the light of the day.\n\nRafales alone would not fulfill the Indian Air Force’s demand for new generation fighters. According to a previous proposal, the IAF was to get 126 jets under Make in India and not 36.\n\nIt has taken 5 years for the first 5 jets to land in India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it in April 2015 during his trip to France.\n\nThe eventual contract was done late 2016, which shows the time taken despite it being Modi’s top priority. This proves how complex the defence procurement process in India is.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions. Quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. Your support will define our work and ThePrint’s future. SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nAs part of the emergency purchases, the armed forces are working on over 100 procurement contracts for sourcing rifles, drones and specialised ammunition.\n\nWonder what the defence planners were doing till now.\n\nThe emergency procurement is being done not just for additional ammunition, but for a spate of new systems, including assault rifles and others.\n\nAlso read: If India wants to tire China out on LAC, it must build fortresses at these pressure points\n\nPM Modi needs to crack the whip\n\nPM Modi should crack the whip on this red-tapism and ensure that India’s soldiers are well-trained, well-equipped and capable enough to face the challenges of the new generation warfare and that of the future.\n\nMerely having a large standing Army or an Air Force with aircraft flying on extended lease of life and without much use against modern weaponry of the enemy, cannot be India’s answer.\n\nIt is time the defence planners sat together and worked out a fresh plan for modernising our armed forces rather than continuing with piecemeal purchases.\n\nThe services are still involved in turf wars and a system of jointness is yet to grow among them.\n\nThe classic case of procuring in silos is the Apache helicopter deal with the US where both the IAF and the Indian Army have done their separate deals, that has costed India at least Rs 2,500 crore more.\n\nWhat the former defence secretary G. Mohan Kumar wrote in The Economic Times sums up the sorry state of affairs: “The armed forces’ 15-year Long Term Integrated Perspective Plans (LTIPP) — the mainstay of their modernisation programme — remains an ambitious paper exercise without any realistic link to the annual capital allocations.”\n\n“With better jointness the LTIPPs could be reworked and prioritised, but slow acquisitions taking several years and uncertainties in funding can plague rapid modernisation,” he wrote.\n\nIt is not just the forces who should be blamed for the mess. The Department of Defence Production, Defence Research and Development Organisation and defence PSUs have no less contributed towards a rotten system that exists today.\n\nAll these organisations need a reboot because the ‘business as usual’ approach would not take India far in the event of a war.\n\nIt is shameful that when war clouds are hovering, the armed forces have to depend on foreign manufacturers to equip themselves.\n\nAlso read: India has two options with stubborn China. The better one involves taking the battle to them\n\nCut down the red tape\n\nIt is important for the Defence Ministry to cut red-tapism when it comes to military procurements.\n\nDespite the urgency shown in the purchase of Rafale fighters, a formal tender for buying another 114 fighters is yet to be issued and one is not sure if the project would even materialise.\n\nA similar delay is being witnessed for the contract of 83 LCA-MK 1A aircraft despite the IAF dealing with the Indian manufacturer, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). A Request For Proposal for the aircraft was issued to HAL in December 2017 but a contract is yet to be signed.\n\nEven in the case of submarines, the procurement process is so intertwined that a formal tender of the much talked about Project 75I-class submarine is yet to be issued. The project was first cleared in 2007.\n\nDelays have also marred the Kamov helicopters and AK-203 Rifle deal with Russia that was announced by PM Modi and Russian President Putin years ago.\n\nThe list of such critical defence deals that are now delayed is long. If this is what happens to projects of priority and emergency, then imagine the fate of regular purchases.\n\nNo wonder many of our infantry soldiers continue to wait for modern bullet-proof jackets, helmets, boots and modern assault rifles.\n\nViews are personal.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

You have to set up a logistics chain, train technical and ground staff in India,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it usually takes up to two years before a new squadron is fully functional. The Rafale squadron will be fully operational when it has at least 18 aircraft.\n\nThe delivery of the remaining Rafale aircraft is expected to be completed by next year.\n\nThe jets, manufactured by French firm Dassault Aviation, took off from France on Monday and landed in the UAE for an overnight stopover. The journey showcased the aircraft's endurance and mid-air fuelling capability.\n\nThe Rafale is a multi-role aircraft, capable of carrying out long-range missions, including highly accurate sea and ground attacks.\n\nAnalysts say the arrival of the jets will boost the morale of the air force, which has been facing a shortage of fighter aircraft.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Rafale jets will boost India's air force fleet\n\nIndia needs 42 squadrons in the scenario of a two-front war with China and Pakistan. But its squadron strength has been depleted to 31, largely because of ageing Russian aircraft.\n\nThe purchase of new fighter jets has been in the making for years. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government began the process in 2000, and its successor, a Congress party-led administration, continued it and issued tenders in 2008 to buy 126 jets.\n\nDassault was finalised as a supplier in 2012, and the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was selected as partner to produce 108 jets in India.\n\nThe deal - from start to finish\n\n2001: India decides to buy 126 fighter jets to strengthen its air force\n\n2007: Tenders are issued\n\n2008: Companies such as America's Boeing, Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, Sweden's Saab and France's Dassault put in bids\n\n2012: Dassault, which submitted the lowest bid, is shortlisted\n\n2014: The deal is put on hold as the BJP's Narendra Modi becomes PM\n\n2015: During his visit to France, Mr Modi announces India's decision to buy 36 \"ready to fly\" Rafale jets\n\n2016: A deal is finalised to buy the 36 jets\n\nBut the deal stalled when the two partners couldn't agree on terms and conditions.\n\nWhen the BJP returned to power under Mr Modi in 2014, he made the procurement of the jets a priority. But rather than taking the deal forward, he surprised many by ordering 36 jets as part of a new deal in which HAL was not included.\n\nThe Indian government says it decided to buy the 36 jets in \"fly-away\" condition to quickly address the problem of the air force's depleting strength.\n\nBut it's not clear where India will procure the remaining aircraft it needs in the long run. The air force announced in 2018 that it would be seeking bids for around 110 more fighter jets, but the deal is yet to be finalised.","title":"Rafale: India gets new jets amid border tension with China","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53573878","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AC61/production/_113692144_iaf.jpg"}

It will have a halt for the night and next day fly to Ambala,” another source told ThePrint.\n\nThe initial plan was that the aircraft would arrive after layovers in multiple countries. However, the Covid pandemic meant that the pilots would have to undergo quarantine at each base, said the sources.\n\nIt has now been decided that two French Airbus mid-air refuellers will fly with the jets. There would be at least two rounds of mid-air refuelling on the way to UAE, the sources said.\n\nIndian mid-air refuellers will take charge the next day for the journey to Ambala. Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots are now getting trained in France for refuelling.

These have started arriving already.\n\nThese missiles include the beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 km away, and the long range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 km away.\n\n“This means that the Rafale could be combat-ready much earlier than expected. The Meteor and SCALP have already been integrated with the Rafales which are coming in,” another source said.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 km away without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-metre-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 km in enemy territory.\n\nAlso read: Kargil hero Col Wangchuk says need strong political will to strengthen India’s borders\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nThe final legal judgement on the controversy was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2019. It dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.[1] The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.[2][3] In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crore).[4] In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints.[5] In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture.[6] After the Indian general election in April–May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress.\n\nAs disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale.[7][8][9] Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable.[10] In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid.[11] On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO Éric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \"95 percent completed\".[12]\n\nDuring an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \"critical operational necessity\".[13] In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun.[14] In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition.[15] In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of €7.87 billion (₹58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to €11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and €8.6 billion quoted in January 2016.[16] Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%.[17]\n\nIn September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.[16] According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package.[18] It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of €91.1 million (₹681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of €94 million (₹703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of €1.8 billion (₹13,470 crore), a weapons package costing €710 million (₹5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of €353 million (₹2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground cruise missile.[19] The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers.[20]\n\nThe agreement included a 50% \"offset clause\", which required the companies involved in the agreement—primarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA—to invest 50% of the contract value (approximately €3.9 billion or ₹30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately €1.2 billion or ₹9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).[18][21] Of this 50%, 74% (approximately €2.9 billion or ₹22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers.[22]\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\" (IDDM) initiative.[23] Dassault intended to invest in excess of €100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations.[24] The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018.[25]. Despite having zero experience in aircraft part production, when Reliance Group was chosen as a partner instead of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, doubts were raised based on closeness of Ambani family with prime minster Narendra Modi[26].\n\nAllegations [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of price escalation [ edit ]\n\nThe day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹715 crore to ₹1,600 crore.[27] A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ₹670 crore.[28][29] In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹526.1 crore to ₹1,570 crore.[30] Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements.[31][32] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender.[33] French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures.[34]\n\nIn an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables.[35]\n\nAllegations of favouritism [ edit ]\n\nModi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones.\n\nIn November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault.[36]\n\nAnil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo-French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%.[30] Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn.[37]\n\nDefence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies.[31] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO.[38] French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total.[34]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nWhile campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack prime minister Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited.[39][40] Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder.[41]\n\nIn December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force.[42][43]\n\n2018 budget session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA.[44] Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam.[45] Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered.[46] In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012.[47][48] Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total.[49] Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals.[50] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public.[51] Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation.[52]\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken.[53]\n\nIndia Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to €99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was €91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements.[54][55] The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ₹525 crore or €79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to €100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as €91.7 million for each aircraft, €1.8 billion for spare parts, €1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, €710 million for weapons and €353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%.[56]\n\nIn an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind.[57][58] A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018.[59]\n\nCongress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ₹1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ₹1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ₹351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security.[60] Dassault's CEO, Éric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals.[61] On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ₹670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\".[28][62]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government.[63] In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ₹45,000 crore was stolen and given to \"an industrialist friend\", referring to Anil Ambani.[64] In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ₹700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \"his friend's company\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited.[65] In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition.[66]\n\n2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ₹45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement.[67][68] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim.[69][70] Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments.[71] Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information.[72]\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was €79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to €100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the €91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper.[73] He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds.[74]\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016.[75] He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth ₹30,000 crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at ₹100,000 crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of ₹130,000 crore and termed it as a theft.[76][77] Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal.[78]\n\nRajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get ₹30,000 crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture—Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited—had 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived.[79]\n\nArun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of ₹1,000 crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations.[80][81] They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so.[82] The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision.[83]\n\nIn response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \"fully loaded\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year.[84][85] M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op-ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of ₹45,000 crore in a contract worth ₹58,000 crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at ₹538 crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to ₹737 crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of ₹670 crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to ₹2,023 crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth ₹30,000 crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of ₹45,000 crore from offsets.[86]\n\nAir Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale\n\nVice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy.[87] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts.[88] Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft.[89] Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal.[90]\n\nNirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational.[91] T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government.[92] Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying.[93] Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft.[94][95]\n\nCongress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal.[96] They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal.[97] Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee.[98] Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.[99] Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \"political witch hunt\".[100] Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal.[101]\n\nQuoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre-existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015.[102] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get ₹30,000 crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only ₹6,500 crore.[103]\n\nReliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.[104]\n\nFrançois Hollande [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France François Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing.[105] When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact.[106] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \"full freedom\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too.[107][108][109] Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance.[110] Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault.[111][112] Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down.[113]\n\nSupreme Court writ petition [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption.[114] Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court.[115] On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October.[116]\n\nOn 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner.[117][118][120] In its ruling, the court said it has \"studied the material carefully\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing.[118] It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government.[118][121] It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement.[118] \"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime’s) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\".[118] It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package.[118] \"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\" the court said.[118][121]\n\nOn the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material.[118][122] \"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\" the court said.[122] The court said \"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\" adding that the \"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\"[123]\n\nChief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\"[124]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nNotwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\"[125] The Indian government promptly rejected the demand.[126] Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal.[127] Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order.[127] Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report.[127]\n\nThe ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed.[128] Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\".[129]\n\nThe petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\"[130] adding that \"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\".[130] While claiming that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\" the trio accused the court of taking a \"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\"[130][131] The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \"full public disclosure of all the facts\" along with \"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\".[131]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \"sharp attack\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\".[132] The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \"expose\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal.[133][clarification needed]\n\nSamajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \"is supreme in the eyes of people\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\" he said.[134] Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC.[135]\n\nPlea for corrections in verdict [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections.[136] The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\"[137][138] By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain.[137] The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report.[137] The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter.[137][139]\n\nOn 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \"self-contradictory\"[140] and to issue notices to the government for \"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\"[141][139] The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\".[139]\n\nThe Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January,[138] along with a review petition from the petitioners.[138][needs update]\n\nFinal Supreme Court judgement [ edit ]\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict from 14 December 2018 on the controversy. It upheld its the previous judgement stating that no irregularities or corruption were found in the deal.[142][143][144] The judgement has been seen with suspicion by some sections as the Chief Justice of India was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Bharatiya Janata Party government within months after his retirement, which was seen as possible quid-pro-quo for delivering a favourable judgement[145].\n\nSee also [ edit ]","title":"Rafale deal controversy","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Rafale_at_Aero_India_2017.jpg"}

Six renowned aircraft manufacturers competed to bag the contract of 126 jets, which was hailed to be the largest-ever defence acquisition deal of India.\n\nThe initial bidders were Lockheed Martin’s F-16s, Boeing’s F/A-18s, Eurofighter Typhoon, Russia’s MiG-35, Sweden’s Saab’s Gripen and Dassault’s Rafale.\n\nAll aircraft were tested by the IAF and after careful analysis on the bids, two of them — Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale — were shortlisted.\n\nDassault received the contract to provide 126 fighter jets as it was the lowest bidder and the aircraft was said to be easy to maintain. After Rafale won the contract, the Indian side and Dassault started negotiations in 2012. Though the initial plan was to buy 126 jets, India scaled it down to 36, that too in fly-away condition.\n\nNo Buyers For Rafale Jets?\n\nDespite boasting of awe-inspiring capabilities and selected by India after a mammoth testing & bidding process, the French origin jets didn’t see many buyers. Other than France and India, only Qatar and Egypt are using Rafale jets and that too in very limited numbers.\n\nAs reported earlier by EurAsian Times, Russian aviation experts had claimed that Rafale jets would have been useless against the Chinese Airforce (PLAAF). The maximum speed of the Rafale jet is about Mach 1.8 compared to Chinese J-16s at Mach 2.2. The Rafale’s practical ceiling is also lower than the J-16s. Even in engine thrust, the Chinese J-16s aka Russian Su-35s are far superior to the French combat aircraft. Even if the Indian Air Force (IAF) was to deploy all 36 of its newly acquired jets, the technical superiority would still be on the side of China, claimed the Russian expert.\n\nThe Rafale is one of the most expensive aircraft in the international market. India’s deal of 36 jets is worth Rs. 60,000 crores. Experts argue that the high cost is the result of many reasons including general inefficiency in the country’s defence sector, along with the small scale on which the Rafale is being produced in comparison to rival fighters such as the F-18, MiG-29 or F-35 due to which Rafale has not benefitted from economies of scale. This has contributed to its poor performance in the international markets.\n\nAnalysts believe that a major hindrance to the Rafale’s success is that it combines a high cost with a very light and unspecialised airframe, meaning that for countries seeking out a high-end fighter, they will turn to look towards something heavier and with more capabilities like the F-15 or Su-35, while for those seeking a cheap medium or lightweight fighter the F-16V, F-18E or MiG-35 would be more cost-effective.\n\nSouth Korea and Singapore selected the powerful F-15 over Rafale in the 2000s. In 2015, Egypt purchased 24 of those jets – with an option for 12 more – under a wider arms agreement with France.\n\nThe following year, in 2016, the two sides entered into a dialogue with Egypt possibly exercising that option, or even expanding the order up to 24 jets. However, even with high-level dialogue between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and French President Emmanuel Macron, Cairo and Paris didn’t finalise the deal. Instead, Egypt inked a deal with Russia to purchase “over two dozen” Su-35 fighter jets.\n\n“Indian media is celebrating the arrival of five Rafales as if they won a war against China. If Rafale is so good, why Oman, Korea, Singapore, Libya, Kuwait, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, UAE, Switzerland, Malaysia refused to buy it. Besides India, only Qatar & Egypt have bought it,” tweeted Ashok Swain, Professor of Peace and Conflict Research, UNESCO Chair of International Water Cooperation.\n\nRafale’s third buyer, India, previously proposed to acquire 126 jets under Make in India and not 36. However, it took five years for even the first five jets to arrive in India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it in April 2015 during his trip to France.\n\nAccording to Snehesh Alex Philip’s opinion piece in ThePrint, beneath the celebration of the arrival of Rafale jets, lies the harsh reality of India’s painfully slow defence purchases. The Rafale deal and a plethora of procurement, now being done under the emergency clause in the wake of tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), exposes the malaise that continues to shadow India’s defence procurement and planning. “Merely having a large standing Army or an Air Force with aircraft flying on an extended lease of life and without much use against modern weaponry of the enemy, cannot be India’s answer,” he wrote.\n\nAccording to analysts, despite heavy marketing by the makers of Rafale, France’s relatively small and inefficient defence sector seems to have met its limit with the fighter program. The small production lines are unable to produce the aircraft quickly or efficiently and the French budget for research and development is smaller in contrast to the US or Russia.\n\nThe aircraft is priced very steeply and most nations prefer to buy US jets not only because of the technical superiority but also to please the Americans instead of the French. The Rafales have seemingly lost the fight in the international market, despite boasting of excellent qualities.","title":"No Buyers For Rafale Jets: Why Almost Every Country Dumped French Rafales Except India?","author":["Eurasian Times Desk"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1596337462000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://eurasiantimes.com/no-buyers-for-rafale-jets-why-almost-every-country-dumped-french-rafales-except-india/","image":"https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rafale-1.jpg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854964"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale jets india","text":"Multi-role combat aircraft family by Dassault\n\nThe Dassault Rafale ( French pronunciation: ​ [ʁafal], literally meaning \"gust of wind\",[9] and \"burst of fire\" in a more military sense)[10] is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \"omnirole\" aircraft by Dassault.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.\n\nMany of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.\n\nIntroduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and Navy (Marine Nationale) had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service.[11] Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal.[12] In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller Dassault Mirage 2000, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles.[13]\n\nIn 1979, the French company Dassault joined the MBB/BAe \"European Collaborative Fighter\" (ECA) project which was renamed the \"European Combat Aircraft\".[14] The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin-engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country.[13] In 1983, the \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.[15]\n\nA number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new EFA programme.[11][N 1] In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project.[17][18] Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon.[19]\n\nDesign phase and prototype\n\nIn France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The French Ministry of Defence required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground, all-day and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's airframe, avionics, propulsion system and armament, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the French Armed Forces. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the Jaguar, Mirage F1C/CR/CT, Mirage 2000C/-5/N in the Armée de l'air, and the F-8P Crusader, Étendard IVP/M and Super Étendard in the Aéronavale.[11][20]\n\nDuring October–December 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning \"Tactical Combat Airplane\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace (meaning \"Bird of Prey\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin.[13] In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a technology demonstrator named Avion de Combat expérimental (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.[13][21]\n\nThe Dassault \"Rafale A\" technology demonstrator in 2006\n\nThe resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system.[11] Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the DGA, France's defence procurement agency.[13] The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in Saint-Cloud, and took its maiden flight on 4 July 1986 from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in southern France.[11] During the one-hour flight, the project's chief test pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of 11,000 metres (36,000 ft) and a speed of Mach 1.3. The 9.5-tonne (21,000 lb) demonstrator stopped in 300 metres (980 ft) upon landing.[22]\n\nThroughout the flight test programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers Clemenceau and Foch to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of Mach 2 (2,450 km/h; 1,520 mph; 1,320 kn) and a height of 13,000 metres (42,000 ft).[23] The demonstrator was initially powered by General Electric F404-GE-400 afterburning turbofans from the F/A-18 Hornet, instead of the Snecma M88, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme.[11][24] It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach 1.4 and demonstrate supercruise, or sustained supersonic flight without use of afterburners. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.[11][23][25]\n\nAt the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac declared that the country would proceed with the US$30 billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996.[26][27][28][29] However, the fall of the Berlin Wall, which signalled the end of the Cold War, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million.[30][31] This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.[11][32][33]\n\nRafale logo\n\nDuring the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging F-8 Crusader, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \"interoperability testing\" aboard the French aircraft carrier Foch. The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.[34][35]\n\nTesting\n\nA two-seater Rafale B during aerial refueling\n\nTo meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \"Rafale C\" (chasseur, meaning \"fighter\" or literally \"hunter\") and the \"Rafale B\" (biplace, or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, man-machine interface and weapons, and expand the flight envelope.[36] Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.[37]\n\nThe C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight.[38] The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993.[36] It was 350 kilograms (770 lb) heavier than the single-seater, but carried 400 litres (110 US gal) less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two 2,000-litre (530 US gal) external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.[39]\n\nA French Navy Rafale M with tail hook deployed during landing aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing Étendard IV Ms & Ps, F-8P Crusaders and Super Étendard Modernisés. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long-term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993.[36][40] Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July–August 1992 and early the following year, at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier Foch in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerhervé, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993.[41]\n\nProduction and upgrades\n\nInitially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the Gulf War showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and reconnaissance missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet.[42] The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \"A\" and 139 \"B\" models\",[40][43] and later to 212 aircraft.[42] The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts.[40][42] Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns,[43] though the two-seater was later cancelled.[23]\n\nProduction of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007.[42] A further order of 59 F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004.[44] In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180.[45]\n\nDuring the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of Dassault Systèmes' CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional computer-aided design, manufacture and engineering software suite that would become standard across the industry.[46] CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as digital mockup and product data management. It consisted of 15 GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support.[46]\n\nThe Rafale final assembly site is located adjacent to Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport\n\nAccording to the French magazine L'Usine nouvelle, apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport. For example, the flight control surfaces are fabricated in Haute-Savoie, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in Val-d'Oise, and the engines in Essonne.[47] Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, Thales and Safran, who rely on a network of 500 subcontractors. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. As of 2012 , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft.[47]\n\nDeliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999.[48] Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board Charles de Gaulle; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the Gulf of Oman, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations.[49] In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training.[40]\n\nThe total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around €45.9 billion,[8] which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately €160.5 million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation.[50] The unit flyaway price as of 2010 was €101.1 million for the F3+ version.[51]\n\nIn 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch miniaturised satellites.[52] In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser-targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity.[53] In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced.[54][55]\n\nIn January 2014, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that €1 billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018.[56][57] The Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later,[58] until replacement by the Franco-German New Generation Fighter.\n\nFuture replacement\n\nIn 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the New Generation Fighter. This fighter aircraft under development by Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence and Space, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2035-40 timeframe.[59]\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with active close-coupled canard to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from −3.6g to 9g (10.5g on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11g can be reached in case of emergency[60][61]). The Rafale is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft and uses digital fly-by-wire flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability.[61][N 2] The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to 115 knots (213 km/h; 132 mph); while in flight, airspeeds as low as 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) have been observed during training missions.[61] According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications.[63]\n\nThe Rafale M features a greatly reinforced undercarriage to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an arrestor hook, and \"jump strut\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including catapult launches.[36] It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based microwave landing system, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the inertial navigation system to external equipment.[39] Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) compared to other variants.[41] The Rafale M retains about 95 percent commonality with Air Force variants including,[64] although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of Charles de Gaulle, France's first nuclear-powered carrier, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, Foch and Clemenceau.[39]\n\nRadar signature\n\nS-duct air intake conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS\n\nAlthough not a full-aspect stealth aircraft, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature .[65][66] In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail-fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine air inlets underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of composite materials and serrated patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards.[58][65] Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite.[67] Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified.[62]\n\nCockpit\n\nThe Rafale's glass cockpit was designed around the principle of data fusion—a central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control.[68] The primary flight controls are arranged in a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed side-stick controller and a left-handed throttle.[69] The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29° to improve g-force tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view.[70] An intelligent flight suit worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.[71]\n\nGreat emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations.[62] Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls.[69] Developed by Crouzet, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and countermeasures systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions.[72] For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.[73]\n\nFor displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment.[74] Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of human–computer interaction (HCI).[13] A head-mounted display (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles.[69][75][76] The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG).[69]\n\nIn the area of life support, the Rafale is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mark 16F \"zero-zero\" ejection seat, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board oxygen generating system, developed by Air Liquide, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters.[77] The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The auto-pilot and autothrottle controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls.[69]\n\nAvionics and equipment\n\nThe Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface.[62][N 3] The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self-protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft.[78] The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters,[79] and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the Airbus A380.[80] According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life.[62]\n\nAnnotated diagram of SPECTRA 's elements\n\nThe Rafale features an integrated defensive-aids system named SPECTRA, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and MBDA.[81] Various methods of detection, jamming, and decoying have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub-systems in the future.[82][N 4] Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) platforms.[83]\n\nThe Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods,[84] such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod.[78] Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot.[85] Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a FLIR.[85]\n\nThe Damocles designation pod was described as \"lacking competitiveness\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods;[86] so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds.[87] A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show[88] and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018.[89] Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms.[90][N 5] Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.[85]\n\nRadar and sensors\n\nThe Rafale was first outfitted with the Thales RBE2 passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain-following and the real-time generation of high resolution ground maps for navigation and targeting.[91] In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months.[66] In September 2006, Flight International reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range.[92]\n\nThe RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200 km,[93] improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar.[94] A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway.[90] In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \"on time and on budget\").[94] By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013.[95]\n\nTo enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or Optronique Secteur Frontal (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and infrared wavelengths.[96] The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the MICA at beyond visual range distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea.[97] Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance.[91] In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally.[94]\n\nArmament and standards\n\nInitial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the F1 (\"France 1\") standard, these had been equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations.[98] Later deliveries were to the \"F2\" standard, which added the capability for conducting both air-to-ground and reconnaissance operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006.[99] Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s.[69][76]\n\nWeapons of the Rafale\n\nF3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air-to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using SCALP EG cruise missiles and AASM Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 Exocet sea skimming missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with ASMP-A missiles.[100] In 2010, France ordered 200 MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service.[101][102]\n\nThe F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.[103]\n\nFor compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with MIL-STD-1760, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment.[62] The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 hardpoints (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30 mm GIAT 30 revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions.[62] According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility.[62]\n\nEngines\n\nCloseup of the rear of the airframe and the two engine nozzles\n\nRafale B in a clean configuration\n\nThe Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to 50 kilonewtons (11,000 pounds-force) of dry thrust and 75 kN (17,000 lb f ) with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures.[62] The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.[104][105]\n\nQualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year.[106] Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine.[11][107] In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2.[108] The engine is of a modular design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard.[106] There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[109] As of 2007, a thrust vectoring variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development.[98]\n\nOperational history\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Naval Aviation\n\nIn December 2000, the French Naval Aviation (Aéronavale), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron Flottille 12F, which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale.[110] Flottille 12F immediately participated in Trident d'Or aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with warships from ten other nations. During the maritime exercise, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings.[110][111] After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004.[112]\n\nThe Rafale M is fully compatible with US Navy aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks.[113] On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on USS Harry S. Truman, a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier.[114]\n\nIn 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard Charles de Gaulle of the French Navy during \"Mission Héraclès\", the French participation in \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while Charles de Gaulle was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India-Pakistan border.[13][115]\n\nIn 2016, Rafales operating from Charles de Gaulle struck targets associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[116]\n\nIn December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while Charles de Gaulle undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions.[117] Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and 17F, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard USS George H.W. Bush for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at Naval Air Station Oceana.[118]\n\nFrench Air Force\n\nFormation of five Rafales making a flypast in 2006\n\nRafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that Escadron de Chasse (Fighter Squadron) 1/7 at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8–10 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when EC 1/7 would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters).[112][119]\n\nIn 2007, after a \"crash program\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to Dushanbe in Tajikistan, while the three others were Rafale Marine of the Navy on board Charles De Gaulle.[120] The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first GBU-12 was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational début of the Rafale.[121] Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at Kandahar International Airport to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces.[122]\n\nOn 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and strike missions over Libya in Opération Harmattan, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of Benghazi.[123] The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead.[83] On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway.[124]\n\nDuring the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \"Hammer\" bombs, a Thales Damoclès targeting pod and two drop tanks;[83] these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft.[125] The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between 125 kilograms (280 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions.[125] Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow SCALP weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra.[126] In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground-attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the close air support role.[125]\n\nA French Air Force Rafale B during Operation Serval in Mali, 2013\n\nIn January 2013, the Rafale took part in \"Opération Serval\", the French military intervention in support to the government of Mali against the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa.[127] The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of Gao, eastern Mali.[128] Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from Timbuktu and Douentza.[129] Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali.[130]\n\nIn August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall.[131]\n\nIn September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of Opération Chammal, France's contribution to the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[132][133] On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zummar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.[134][135]\n\nIn April 2018, during the Syrian Civil War, five Rafale B fighters from the Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Each jet was loaded with two SCALP EG missiles.[136]\n\nEgypt\n\nIn November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement.[137] By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the Suez Canal expansion in August 2015.[138]\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales,[139] as part of a larger deal, including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and missiles, worth US$5.9 billion (€5.2 billion).[140][141] The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in Istres.[142] In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters.[143] All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force.[144] Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single-seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the Egyptian Air Force.[145] Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017.[146] The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales.[147]\n\nIn June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract.[148][149] An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations.[150]\n\nQatar\n\nA Qatari Rafale at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in 2019.\n\nStarting in 2011, the Qatar Emiri Air Force evaluated the Rafale alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Boeing F-15E, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace its Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales.[151] On 30 April 2015, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani announced to French President François Hollande that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft.[152] On 4 May, a €6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as €263M for each aircraft.[153][154] On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for €1.1 billion (or €92M each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters.[155] The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019.[156][157]\n\nIndia\n\nRafale of the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale.[158] In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs.[159] In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4 billion contract.[160] On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder.[161][162] It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under transfer of technology agreements.[163][164] The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion.[165][166]\n\nThe deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The Indian Defence Ministry instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft.[167][168] In May 2013, The Times of India reported that negotiations were \"back on track\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017.[169] Another point of contention was a provision where Dassault was to reinvest 50 percent of the deal's earnings into India's defence sectors, either through purchases or technological expertise.[170][171] In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL.[172] By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015.[173]\n\nA Rafale landing at Ambala Air Force Station on its first arrival in India on 29 July 2020.\n\nIn April 2015, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris, India requested the rapid delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition.[174][175] Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years.[176] India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015.[177] Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities.[178] In January 2016, the Indian government directed the Indian Navy to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters.[179] Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales.[180] On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a €7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price.[181] The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years.[182] The deal includes weapons and spares, which included Meteor BVRAAM missiles.[183][184] India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China.[185]\n\nThe Indian National Congress raised an issue over Dassault partnering with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence, now known as Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited(R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner; Gandhi alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence.[186][187] Party spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹7.15 billion to ₹16 billion.[188] In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the Supreme Court for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal.[189][190]\n\nIn March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing MiG-21s and to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s.[191] Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart; it had tail number \"RB-001\" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal.[192]\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.[193]\n\nDelivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Airforce from France.[194]\n\nPotential operators\n\nAnalysts view the relatively quick series of 84[195] orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the Arab Spring and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East.[196]\n\nFinland\n\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[197]\n\nIn December 2015 Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the United States where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program.[198] The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.[199]\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) Mikoyan MiG-29, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[200] In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region.[201][202]\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs.[203] A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated.[204] Although a leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds,[N 6] on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs.[206] Due to a referendum, this purchase never happened.\n\nIn March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35.[207][208] In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons.[209] In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at Payerne Air Base for comparison against other bids.[210]\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nIn 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles.[211] In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed.[212] However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Union Defence Force, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in November 2011 called the French offer \"uncompetitive and unworkable\";[213] France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6 billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale.[214] Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon[215] or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[216]\n\nThe newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait.[217] In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit.[218] In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft.[219] In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s.[220] In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales.[221] In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE.[222]\n\nOthers\n\nSpain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.[223]\n\nIn January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its air force.[224]\n\nFailed bids\n\nThe Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100 million (2010),[225] while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour.[226] The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate.[226] According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.[227]\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance offered economic and technology partnerships in its bid for the Rafale to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters starting in 2023 as part of the air combat capability successor program. Other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35.[228] On 25 October 2018, Belgium selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace around 54 F-16s; government officials stated that the decision came down to price and that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven valuation criteria\"; the total purchasing price for the aircraft and support until 2030 totaled €4 billion, €600 million cheaper than the initial budget of €4.6 billion.[229][230]\n\nBrazil\n\nIn June 2008, the Brazilian Air Force issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, Su-35, Gripen NG and Eurofighter Typhoon.[231] In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2 – Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F.[232] On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs.[233][234] In February 2011, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18.[235] After delays due to budget constraints,[236] in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5 billion deal to equip the air force.[237]\n\nCanada\n\nThe Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fleet.[238] In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions.[239] In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002.[240][241] In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin.[242] In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition.[243] Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35.[244] In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs.[245][246] In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.[247][248]\n\nKuwait\n\nIn February 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales.[249] In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms.[250] Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests.[251] In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18–22 Rafales.[252] However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons.[253][254]\n\nLibya\n\nIn January 2007, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24 billion\".[255] In December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi declared Libya's interest in the Rafale,[256] but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international military intervention during the 2011 Libyan civil war.[257]\n\nSingapore\n\nIn 2005, the Republic of Singapore Air Force embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. A number of options were considered and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two – Dassault Rafale and the F-15SG Strike Eagle. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft.[258] According to Defense Industry Daily, one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration.[259]\n\nOthers\n\nIn 2002, the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F-15K Slam Eagle over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft F-X Phase 1 fighter competition.[260]\n\nDuring 2006, while there was potentially trouble with Anglo-American negotiations over the F-35 Lightning II, there was talk of purchasing the Rafale M for Britain's Royal Navy.[261] However, in May 2012, after having abandoned the F-35B STOVL version in favour of the F-35C CATOBAR variant in October 2010, the UK reverted to purchasing the F-35B.[262][263]\n\nIn late 2007, La Tribune reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead.[264][265] While French Defense Minister Herve Morin labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations.[265][266]\n\nIn February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of SEPECAT Jaguars.[267] In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons.[268][269]\n\nVariants\n\nRafale B/C and M\n\nRafale A Technology demonstrator, first flew in 1986.[11] Rafale D Dassault used this designation (D for discrète) in the early 1990s to emphasise the new semi-stealthy design features.[270] Rafale B F3-R Two-seater version for the French Air Force.[36] \"It can operate with the Talios targeting pod (45 ordered by French army will delivered between 2019 and 2023).\"[271] Rafale C F3-R Same as Rafale B F3-R but Single-seat version for the French Air Force.[36] Rafale M F3-R Same as Rafale C F3-R but Carrier-borne version for the French Naval Aviation, which entered service in 2001. For carrier operations, the M model has a strengthened airframe, longer nose gear leg to provide a more nose-up attitude, larger tailhook between the engines, and a built-in boarding ladder. Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg (1,100 lb) more than the Rafale C.[36][272] It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise.[273] Rafale N Originally called the Rafale BM, was a planned missile-only two-seater version for the Aéronavale.[49] Budgetary and technical constraints have been cited as grounds for its cancellation.[23] Rafale R Proposed reconnaissance-oriented variant.[65] Rafale DM Two-seater version for the Egyptian Air Force.[274] Rafale EM Single-seat version for the Egyptian Air Force.[275] Rafale DH Two-seater version for the Indian Air Force.[276] Rafale EH Single-seat version for the Indian Air Force.[6] Rafale B, C, M F4 ( first step 4.1, second step 4.2) It will upgrade radar (F4.1), as well as improved capabilities in the Helmet-Mounted Display and AASM 1000 kg, OSF (long range optoelectronics system) will be receive an IRST( Infrared Search and Track ) for detecting and identifying airborne stealth targets at long range (F4.1), it will be more effective in network-centric warfare, more data exchange and satellite communication and will launch small (F4.2) . It as be ordered in 2019.:All 180 French Rafale B,C,M will be upgraded to F4.1 in 2022 and F4.2 in 2027,[271][277] moreover a further 30 aircraft at the full F4 standard (F4.2) will be ordered in 2023 and delivered between 2027 and 2030.[278]\n\nOperators\n\nMap with Dassault Rafale operators in blue, with orders in cyan\n\nFrance A total of 180 have been ordered out of a planned 286, with an option for another 9.[76] Approximately 152 are confirmed to be delivered by 2018.[279][280] As of 2017 , 149 had been delivered. In 2018 three Rafale will be delivered, and then in 2024 all the 28 remaining out of the 180 ordered will be delivered.[276][281][282]\n\nEgyptian Air Force – 24 Rafales in service of the 24 ordered as of December 2018.[147][286]\n\nQatar Air Force – Qatar ordered 24 of the fighters in 2015, adding 12 more in 2018. It also has an option to buy 36 more.[290] As of February 2020, 23 were delivered.[291]\n\nNotable accidents\n\nOn 6 December 2007, a French Air Force twin-seat Rafale crashed during a training flight. The pilot, who suffered from spatial disorientation, was killed in the accident. [292]\n\nOn 24 September 2009, after unarmed test flights, two French Navy Rafales returning to the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, collided in mid-air about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the town of Perpignan in southwest France. One test pilot, identified as François Duflot, was killed in the accident, while the other was rescued.[293]\n\nSpecifications\n\nAASM-Hammer family of weapons\n\nMICA: short- to medium-range air-to-air missile\n\nData from Dassault Aviation,[294] Superfighters,[295] French Navy,[296] International Directory of Military Aircraft[297]\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 1 or 2\n\n1 or 2 Length: 15.27 m (50 ft 1 in)\n\n15.27 m (50 ft 1 in) Wingspan: 10.90 m (35 ft 9 in)\n\n10.90 m (35 ft 9 in) Height: 5.34 m (17 ft 6 in)\n\n5.34 m (17 ft 6 in) Wing area: 45.7 m 2 (492 sq ft)\n\n45.7 m (492 sq ft) Empty weight: 10,300 kg (22,708 lb) (B)[69][294]\n\nGross weight: 15,000 kg (33,069 lb)\n\n15,000 kg (33,069 lb) Max takeoff weight: 24,500 kg (54,013 lb)\n\n24,500 kg (54,013 lb) Fuel capacity: 4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( C ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( B )\n\n4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( ) Maximum fuel: ( C ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) [ citation needed ]\n\n( ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) Powerplant: 2 × Snecma M88-2 turbofans, 50.04 kN (11,250 lbf) thrust each [298] dry, 75 kN (17,000 lbf) with afterburner\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 2,223 km/h (1,381 mph, 1,200 kn) [299] / Mach 1.8[300] at high altitude\n\n1,390 km/h, 860 mph, 750 kn / Mach 1.1 at low altitude\n\nSupercruise: [301] Mach 1.4 [ citation needed ]\n\nMach 1.4 Combat range: 1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs.\n\n1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs. Ferry range: 3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks\n\n3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks Service ceiling: 15,835 m (51,952 ft)\n\n15,835 m (51,952 ft) g limits: + 9 − 3.6 ( + 11 in emergencies) [60] [302] [303]\n\n9 3.6 ( 11 in emergencies) Rate of climb: 304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min)\n\n304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min) Wing loading: 328 kg/m 2 (67 lb/sq ft)\n\n328 kg/m (67 lb/sq ft) Thrust/weight: 0.988 (100% fuel, 2 EM A2A missile, 2 IR A2A missile) version B\n\nArmament\n\n\n\nAvionics\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nRelated lists\n\nNotes\n\n^ [16] Quote: \"Dassault demands design leadership as the price for European co-operation.\" ^ [62] Quote: \"Longitudinal stability is moderately negative with a full fly-by-wire digital control system.

Indian Air Force (IAF) is getting ready to receive and finally induct five Rafale fighter aircraft which took off from Merignac in France today. These aircraft are expected to arrive in India later this week. Confirming this IAF has said that “These aircraft are landing on July 29, and the focus is on integrating the pilots and the machine with the overall IAF operations at the earliest.” Usually, the time taken to deploy new fighters takes around six months, these aircraft are arriving in the midst of ongoing tensions along the Line of Actual Control between India and China and the fighter, machines will be deployed within a week.\n\nAs has been reported by Financial Express Online earlier, in the first round 12 IAF pilots have undergone intense training in France, and since last September they have been training on the trainers which were handed over to the defence minister Rajnath Singh at a ceremony in that country.\n\nOverall, as per the contract between the two countries, India has ordered 36 `Rafale’ from Dassault Aviation and the same number of pilots have to undergo training as well as the ground staff. And on return to India, they will continue training at the Gwalior Air Force Station, home to the French Mirage 2000.\n\nThere is still no clarity on the number of fighters landing on Wednesday, July 29. The number could either be five or six. And, after this initial delivery, as per the contract the French Company is expected to deliver 12 aircraft every year. So far the company has handed over nine fighter jets to India which is in different stages of testing before they land here in India.\n\nFlight Plan\n\nFinancial Express Online had recently reported that the aircraft will take off from the production facility of Dassault Aviation located in Merignac, France.\n\nFor the night halt they will take a break at the French airbase in Al Dhafra, located near Abu Dhabi in UAW.\n\nFor the ten hour-long flight, there will be two mid-air refuellers to refuel the fighter jets twice during the journey and they will be from the French Air Force.\n\nThe pilots ferrying the aircraft are from the IAF and they have undergone specialized training for the mid-air refuelling process through Airbus 330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft which is in use with the French Air Force.\n\nThese aircraft will then next day will head to India and straight to IAF’s 17 Squadron `Golden Arrows’ based at the Ambala Air Force Station. This Squadron will be the home for the first Squadron of the French Rafale.\n\nWeapons onboard\n\nIn view of the tensions with China, India had reached out to France to expedite the delivery of the fighters and the weapons on board.\n\nMeteor air to air missile from the European MBDA has already reached Ambala. This missile is ram jet-powered air to air missile and has a very long-range rocket.\n\nCosting approximately Rs 20 crore each, these missiles have a range of about 150 km and have the capability of attacking an enemy aircraft and that too without leaving Indian airspace.\n\nOther missile coming with Rafale is `Scalp’ which weighs around 1,300 kg and is 5.1 metre-long. And has a 600 km range manufactured by MBDA and is known for precision.","title":"Countdown begins for Rafale!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854969"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale jets india","text":"The Indian Air Force (IAF) has much to cheer with the arrival of five Rafale omni-role fighter jets in terms of the technology and capability accretion that it brings. In the words of the Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria and former ACM B.S. Dhanoa, Rafale is a “game changer”.\n\nEncapsulating what the Rafales bring in, ACM Bhadauria said in February that at the time of the Kargil conflict in 1999, India had an edge over Pakistan in terms of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile capability. “We allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade-and-a-half of struggle in the acquisition process to be able to get better capability,” he said. The Rafale, armed with the Meteor BVR air-to-air missile, will restore that edge in the neighbourhood as there is no equivalent to it currently.\n\nAccording to its manufacturer Dassault Aviation, Rafale is an omni-role fighter capable of the entire spectrum of roles — air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. With its advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, electronic warfare suite and network-centric capabilities in addition to its armaments, Rafale is now the most advanced fighter in the IAF arsenal, overtaking the SU-30MKI, which is due for major upgrades.\n\nRafale is also the first imported fighter to join service in over two decades since the SU-30s in the late 1990s. Rafale has 14 hard points for weapons and can carry a total external load of over 9 tonnes. In addition to the Meteor, it is armed with SCALP long-range stand-off attack air-to-ground missiles and MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles. The latest addition, HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) medium range air-to-ground missiles, is being procured through the emergency route.\n\nAnother significant factor with the Rafales is that as per contract, at least 75% of the Rafale fleet has to be operationally available, which would make it the most available fighter in the IAF fleet. The first Rafale squadron, No. 17 Golden Arrows, will be based at Ambala and the second squadron will be at Hasimara. All 36 aircraft will be delivered on schedule by end 2021, the Indian Embassy in France said last week.\n\nThe €7.87 billion (₹59,262 crore) inter-governmental agreement, signed in September 2016 between India and France for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition, also includes 13 India-Specific Enhancements (ISE), the non-recurring design and development cost of which is ₹9,855 crore. Some of them pertain to radar enhancements, helmet mounted display, ability to start and operate from high altitude airfields, advanced infrared search and track sensor and a very potent electronic jammer pod.\n\nThe deal also epitomises the cumbersome defence procurement process in which government-to-government deals have of late become the way out. Rafale was originally selected under the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft tender issued in 2007, which itself was conceived as a Mig-21 replacement project in early 2000s. Rafale was selected in 2012 but negotiations got stuck due to differences and the tender was eventually withdrawn after the emergency purchase announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April 2015, citing “critical operational necessity” of the IAF.\n\nFalling numbers\n\nHowever, the 36 Rafales will do little to arrest the falling numbers of fighter squadrons of the IAF, which has a sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons but is down to 31 at present. To offset that, the IAF is banking on the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). A contract for 83 LCA-Mk1A is in final stages and they are in addition to the 40 jets already contracted for. A more advanced LCA-Mk2 is also in the works. The government has recently approved the procurement of 21 MIG-29 jets from Russia, which will add two additional squadrons. In addition, 12 SU-30MKI aircraft have also been approved, which will replenish the numbers of Sukhois lost in crashes. The IAF will also phase out five squadrons of Mig-21s in the the next few years.\n\nWhile the IAF works to keep the numbers from falling further, the Rafale, which joins the IAF at a time of unprecedented tensions on the border with China, will give a qualitative edge to the force in the region.","title":"Rafale jets | The ‘game-changer’ fighters","author":["Law In Question Is Unconstitutional","Rooted In Colonialism","They Say","In The Past Months","They Were Done Primarily Through Embassies"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-jets-the-game-changer-fighters/article32249724.ece","image":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l9uzfv/article32249721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-RAFALE-1"}

With the announcement, the Modi government ended negotiations to buy 126 Rafale jets after the aircraft had been selected by the Indian Air Force in 2012 during the tenure of the Manmohan Singh government.\n\nThe Congress had bitterly criticised the Modi government's order for 36 Rafale jets, claiming \"its deal\" for 126 aircraft was more economical and levelled corruption allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tharoor tweeted, \"Two yrs ago @INCIndia asked why the ModiGovt had reduced UPA's planned purchase of 128 Rafales to just 36. We never got an answer. Today Western strategic experts ask the same question as India gears up to face China in the mountains: why not more Rafales?\"\n\nThe opinion of \"western strategic experts\" Tharoor referred to was based on an article in Forbes magazine on June 19, which was titled, \"India is buying the wrong warplanes for fighting China\".\n\nTwo yrs ago @INCIndia asked why the ModiGovt had reduced UPA's planned purchase of 128 Rafales to just 36.

Today Western strategic experts ask the same question as India gears up to face China in the mountains: why not more Rafales?https://t.co/8dX9KvIXEz — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) July 1, 2020\n\nThe article refers to the Indian Air Force's impending purchase of 21 MiG-29 and 12 Su-30MKI fighters from Russia. The Su-30MKI is numerically the most important fighter in the Indian Air Force. The Indian Air Force operates more than 250 Su-30MKI fighters. The Su-30MKI is also the heaviest fighter aircraft in the IAF fleet. It was the P.V. Narasimha Rao government that finalised the first order for the Su-30 jet in the mid-1990s, with every subsequent dispensation placing follow-up orders.\n\nThe Forbes article noted, \"The Su-30 not only lacks the latest precision air-to-ground ordnance, it doesn’t perform well from the high-altitude air bases that support Indian operations...\" along the Line of Actual Control.\n\nThe Forbes article quoted veteran aviation journalist Tom Cooper, who claims, \"for decades, the Mirage 2000 has been a more effective fighter in Indian service than the Su-30 has been\".\n\nAccording to Forbes, Cooper had argued on Facebook, the Su-30MKI \"doesn’t work well\" in taking off from the Leh airport, which is 11,000 feet above sea level. At high-altitude airfields, aircraft face a greater strain on their engines on account of the thinner air and find it difficult to take off at their maximum weight. Cooper was also critical about the Su-30MKI's tires and brakes.\n\nWhile many commentators have argued that buying additional Su-30MKI jets is a more cost-effective option than ordering more Rafale jets, others have criticised the Russian jet's poor serviceability record in Indian Air Force service. One of the factors touted in support of the order for 36 Rafale fighters was the French aircraft’s higher operational availability when compared with the Su-30MKI.\n\nPertinently, China operates hundreds of aircraft derived from the same design as the Su-30MKI, such as the Su-30, J-11, J-16 and Su-35. In addition, the Su-30MKI's larger size and relative lack of stealth features mean it can be detected more quickly by radar than the smaller Rafale.\n\nThe Rafale is being considered by the Indian Air Force for an order for 114 jets, along with offerings from US, Russian and European companies. However, a decision for the 114-jet contract, estimated to be valued at $15 billion, will take at least a year.\n\nTharoor's tweet may just reignite debate on an old topic!","title":"Tharoor asks why Modi govt isn't buying more Rafale jets","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1593648000000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/07/02/tharoor-asks-why-modi-govt-isnt-buying-more-rafale-jets.html","image":"https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2019/6/25/garuda-5-jodhpur-french-embassy.jpg"}

However, the Covid pandemic meant that the pilots would have to undergo quarantine at each base, said the sources.\n\nIt has now been decided that two French Airbus mid-air refuellers will fly with the jets.

These have started arriving already.\n\nThese missiles include the beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 km away, and the long range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 km away.\n\n“This means that the Rafale could be combat-ready much earlier than expected. The Meteor and SCALP have already been integrated with the Rafales which are coming in,” another source said.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 km away without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-metre-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 km in enemy territory.\n\nAlso read: Kargil hero Col Wangchuk says need strong political will to strengthen India’s borders\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854972"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale","text":"Controversy originating from the Indian MRCA competition\n\nA Dassault Rafale flying at Aero India 2017\n\nThe Rafale deal controversy is a political controversy in India related to the purchase of 36 multirole fighter aircraft for a price estimated at €.8 billion by the Defence Ministry of India from France's Dassault Aviation. The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nThe final legal judgement on the controversy was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2019. It dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement and upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.[1] The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.[2][3] In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crore).[4] In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints.[5] In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture.[6] After the Indian general election in April–May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress.\n\nAs disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale.[7][8][9] Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable.[10] In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid.[11] On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO Éric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \"95 percent completed\".[12]\n\nDuring an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \"critical operational necessity\".[13] In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun.[14] In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition.[15] In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of €7.87 billion (₹58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to €11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and €8.6 billion quoted in January 2016.[16] Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%.[17]\n\nIn September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.[16] According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package.[18] It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of €91.1 million (₹681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of €94 million (₹703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of €1.8 billion (₹13,470 crore), a weapons package costing €710 million (₹5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of €353 million (₹2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to-ground cruise missile.[19] The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers.[20]\n\nThe agreement included a 50% \"offset clause\", which required the companies involved in the agreement—primarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA—to invest 50% of the contract value (approximately €3.9 billion or ₹30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately €1.2 billion or ₹9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).[18][21] Of this 50%, 74% (approximately €2.9 billion or ₹22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers.[22]\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\" (IDDM) initiative.[23] Dassault intended to invest in excess of €100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations.[24] The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018.[25]. Despite having zero experience in aircraft part production, when Reliance Group was chosen as a partner instead of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, doubts were raised based on closeness of Ambani family with prime minster Narendra Modi[26].\n\nAllegations [ edit ]\n\nAllegations of price escalation [ edit ]\n\nThe day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹715 crore to ₹1,600 crore.[27] A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ₹670 crore.[28][29] In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹526.1 crore to ₹1,570 crore.[30] Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements.[31][32] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender.[33] French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures.[34]\n\nIn an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables.[35]\n\nAllegations of favouritism [ edit ]\n\nModi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones.\n\nIn November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault.[36]\n\nAnil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo-French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%.[30] Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn.[37]\n\nDefence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies.[31] Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO.[38] French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total.[34]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nWhile campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack prime minister Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited.[39][40] Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder.[41]\n\nIn December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force.[42][43]\n\n2018 budget session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA.[44] Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam.[45] Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered.[46] In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012.[47][48] Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total.[49] Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals.[50] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public.[51] Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation.[52]\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken.[53]\n\nIndia Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to €99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was €91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements.[54][55] The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ₹525 crore or €79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to €100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as €91.7 million for each aircraft, €1.8 billion for spare parts, €1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, €710 million for weapons and €353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%.[56]\n\nIn an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind.[57][58] A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018.[59]\n\nCongress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ₹1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ₹1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ₹351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security.[60] Dassault's CEO, Éric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals.[61] On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ₹670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\".[28][62]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government.[63] In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ₹45,000 crore was stolen and given to \"an industrialist friend\", referring to Anil Ambani.[64] In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ₹700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \"his friend's company\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited.[65] In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition.[66]\n\n2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament [ edit ]\n\nThe motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ₹45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement.[67][68] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim.[69][70] Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments.[71] Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information.[72]\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was €79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to €100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the €91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper.[73] He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds.[74]\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016.[75] He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth ₹30,000 crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at ₹100,000 crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of ₹130,000 crore and termed it as a theft.[76][77] Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal.[78]\n\nRajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get ₹30,000 crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture—Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited—had 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived.[79]\n\nArun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of ₹1,000 crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations.[80][81] They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so.[82] The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision.[83]\n\nIn response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \"fully loaded\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year.[84][85] M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op-ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of ₹45,000 crore in a contract worth ₹58,000 crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at ₹538 crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to ₹737 crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of ₹670 crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to ₹2,023 crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth ₹30,000 crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of ₹45,000 crore from offsets.[86]\n\nAir Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale\n\nVice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy.[87] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts.[88] Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft.[89] Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal.[90]\n\nNirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational.[91] T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government.[92] Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying.[93] Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft.[94][95]\n\nCongress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal.[96] They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal.[97] Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee.[98] Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra.[99] Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \"political witch hunt\".[100] Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal.[101]\n\nQuoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre-existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015.[102] Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get ₹30,000 crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only ₹6,500 crore.[103]\n\nReliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.[104]\n\nFrançois Hollande [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France François Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing.[105] When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact.[106] The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \"full freedom\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too.[107][108][109] Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance.[110] Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault.[111][112] Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down.[113]\n\nSupreme Court writ petition [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption.[114] Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court.[115] On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October.[116]\n\nOn 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner.[117][118][120] In its ruling, the court said it has \"studied the material carefully\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing.[118] It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government.[118][121] It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement.[118] \"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime’s) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\".[118] It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package.[118] \"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\" the court said.[118][121]\n\nOn the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material.[118][122] \"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\" the court said.[122] The court said \"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\" adding that the \"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\"[123]\n\nChief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\"[124]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nNotwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\"[125] The Indian government promptly rejected the demand.[126] Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal.[127] Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order.[127] Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report.[127]\n\nThe ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed.[128] Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\".[129]\n\nThe petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\"[130] adding that \"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\".[130] While claiming that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\" the trio accused the court of taking a \"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\"[130][131] The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \"full public disclosure of all the facts\" along with \"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\".[131]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \"sharp attack\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\".[132] The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \"expose\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal.[133][clarification needed]\n\nSamajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \"is supreme in the eyes of people\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\" he said.[134] Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC.[135]\n\nPlea for corrections in verdict [ edit ]\n\nOn 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections.[136] The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\"[137][138] By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain.[137] The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report.[137] The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter.[137][139]\n\nOn 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \"self-contradictory\"[140] and to issue notices to the government for \"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\"[141][139] The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\".[139]\n\nThe Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January,[138] along with a review petition from the petitioners.[138][needs update]\n\nFinal Supreme Court judgement [ edit ]\n\nOn 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict from 14 December 2018 on the controversy. It upheld its the previous judgement stating that no irregularities or corruption were found in the deal.[142][143][144] The judgement has been seen with suspicion by some sections as the Chief Justice of India was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Bharatiya Janata Party government within months after his retirement, which was seen as possible quid-pro-quo for delivering a favourable judgement[145].\n\nSee also [ edit ]","title":"Rafale deal controversy","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Rafale_at_Aero_India_2017.jpg"}

(Image Credit: MBDA\n\nBy Wing Commander Amit Ranjan Giri\n\n“The balance rests on us”–this was the catchphrase of the IAF when the first MiG 29 thundered down and took to the skies in Pune, in the mid-eighties, heralding the parity in new generation fighter jets between the PAF and IAF. The PAF had acquired the F-16 Fighting Falcons a couple of years before. This time around, with the induction of the Rafale, does the IAF need more than a catchy tag line to keep the PLAAF at bay?\n\nAs Group Captain Harkirat and his boys land the latest fighting machines at Ambala, five in all, two twins seaters (RB series) and three single-seaters (BS series), they propel the IAF to another level of air fighting capability, one which would enhance itself with the acquisition of all 36 Rafales and associated weaponry in the near future. An interesting trivia about IAF fighters is that, Russian fighters generally come in huge crates and are assembled in India whereas most ‘western’ fighters are flown in, from the OEM country. This, by no means, indicates that the incoming Rafales would be able to take on the enemy immediately, it would take the IAF a little time before these jets are operationalised with a plethora of weaponry, the earlier the better.\n\nHow does the Rafale fare against the Chinese fighters?\n\nThe Rafales’ main contender in the PLAAF would be the Chengdu J-20 and if produced and operationalised the Shenyang J-31, both are highly rated by the Chinese media and pitched as fifth-generation stealth fighters against the Rafales’ 4.5 generation lineage. That having been said, the Chinese fighters’ capabilities are only on paper, much of them are yet to be demonstrated or proven. True, the Rafale lacks stealth but is built around the low RCS philosophy whereas, though the J-20 proclaims itself as a proponent of stealth the ‘canards’ in front and additional external hardpoints for extra fuel tanks would shatter much of its claims in this department. Just to clear the air around stealth – absolute all aspect stealth is a myth, at least as of now. Aeroplanes claiming stealth are actually low observables depending on their aspect – the way they look to the enemy sensors- never invisible from all direction. The IAF has been known to pick up Chinese J-20s on their Su 30 radars earlier.\n\nEngine, weapons and avionics: who gets the better score?\n\nWith limited internal capacity of weapons and no ‘supercruise’ capability as yet, the Chinese contenders do have a lot to live up to. The Rafale, in this aspect, delivers what it promises – low RCS, excellent weapon carriage capability – albeit external and supercruise – the ability to go supersonic without afterburners. When it comes to avionics, all three aircraft would pitch ‘neck to neck’. All boast of one of the most advanced radars – the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) and all three have equivalent avionics suites onboard. However, it is yet to be seen if the Chinese have been able to integrate these technologies to match, compute and present the desired data – a capability which leapfrogs an aircraft to the next level. The Rafale’s SPECTRA defensive aids system is a classic example of this – processing and amalgamating information from various sensors to safeguard the aircraft.\n\nThe SCALP and Meteor are some of the goodies in the Rafale package for the IAF. Whilst the former is a ground attack precision weapon, the latter, is one of the best BeyondVisualRange (BVR) air to air missiles available at present. The J-20 in comparison carries the PL series of missiles with the PL 15 matching up with the Meteor in terms of range. As per the last reports, the PL 21 with enhanced range was yet to be operationalised.\n\nPedigree versus Pariah, who wins?\n\nThe Rafale comes from an ancestry of well-known fighters which Dassault has produced and earned their place in the annals of history. If western intelligence reports are to be believed the Chinese fighters have been an attempted copy of the F 22 Raptor and the F 35 Lightning, curtsy hackers who had managed to steal substantial amount of data from the US servers.\n\nApart from the privileged pedigree the Rafale is also combat-proven – Libya, Iraq and Syria were all contemporary conflicts wherein the French fighter has been able to earn a name for itself. The Chinese fighters, in contrast, are yet to be proven in battle, as far as the J-31 goes there are doubts if the machine has gone beyond the prototype stage as yet. The J-20, on the other hand, does enjoy an edge over its single-engined cousin, it has entered the production stage and rumours of about one squadron of this type with PLAAF has surfaced in the intelligence circle.\n\nAll the above being said it needs to be appreciated that no comparison of fighting machines can be justified with data on paper – a lot goes in exploiting platforms during the war and a major portion of the winning effort comes from other non-tangible factors – the side which exploits the entire spectrum generally lands up on the victorious side.\n\n(The author is Indian Air Force Veteran.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854974"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale","text":"Multi-role combat aircraft family by Dassault\n\nThe Dassault Rafale ( French pronunciation: ​ [ʁafal], literally meaning \"gust of wind\",[9] and \"burst of fire\" in a more military sense)[10] is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \"omnirole\" aircraft by Dassault.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major defence contractors, such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.\n\nMany of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.\n\nIntroduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the Indian Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and Navy (Marine Nationale) had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service.[11] Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal.[12] In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller Dassault Mirage 2000, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles.[13]\n\nIn 1979, the French company Dassault joined the MBB/BAe \"European Collaborative Fighter\" (ECA) project which was renamed the \"European Combat Aircraft\".[14] The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin-engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country.[13] In 1983, the \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.[15]\n\nA number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new EFA programme.[11][N 1] In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project.[17][18] Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon.[19]\n\nDesign phase and prototype\n\nIn France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The French Ministry of Defence required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground, all-day and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's airframe, avionics, propulsion system and armament, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the French Armed Forces. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the Jaguar, Mirage F1C/CR/CT, Mirage 2000C/-5/N in the Armée de l'air, and the F-8P Crusader, Étendard IVP/M and Super Étendard in the Aéronavale.[11][20]\n\nDuring October–December 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (Avion de Combat Tactique, meaning \"Tactical Combat Airplane\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename Rapace (meaning \"Bird of Prey\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of canards, delta wings and a single vertical tail-fin.[13] In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a technology demonstrator named Avion de Combat expérimental (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.[13][21]\n\nThe Dassault \"Rafale A\" technology demonstrator in 2006\n\nThe resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system.[11] Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the DGA, France's defence procurement agency.[13] The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in Saint-Cloud, and took its maiden flight on 4 July 1986 from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in southern France.[11] During the one-hour flight, the project's chief test pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of 11,000 metres (36,000 ft) and a speed of Mach 1.3. The 9.5-tonne (21,000 lb) demonstrator stopped in 300 metres (980 ft) upon landing.[22]\n\nThroughout the flight test programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers Clemenceau and Foch to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of Mach 2 (2,450 km/h; 1,520 mph; 1,320 kn) and a height of 13,000 metres (42,000 ft).[23] The demonstrator was initially powered by General Electric F404-GE-400 afterburning turbofans from the F/A-18 Hornet, instead of the Snecma M88, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme.[11][24] It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach 1.4 and demonstrate supercruise, or sustained supersonic flight without use of afterburners. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.[11][23][25]\n\nAt the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac declared that the country would proceed with the US$30 billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996.[26][27][28][29] However, the fall of the Berlin Wall, which signalled the end of the Cold War, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million.[30][31] This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.[11][32][33]\n\nRafale logo\n\nDuring the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging F-8 Crusader, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \"interoperability testing\" aboard the French aircraft carrier Foch. The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.[34][35]\n\nTesting\n\nA two-seater Rafale B during aerial refueling\n\nTo meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \"Rafale C\" (chasseur, meaning \"fighter\" or literally \"hunter\") and the \"Rafale B\" (biplace, or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, man-machine interface and weapons, and expand the flight envelope.[36] Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.[37]\n\nThe C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight.[38] The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993.[36] It was 350 kilograms (770 lb) heavier than the single-seater, but carried 400 litres (110 US gal) less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two 2,000-litre (530 US gal) external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.[39]\n\nA French Navy Rafale M with tail hook deployed during landing aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing Étendard IV Ms & Ps, F-8P Crusaders and Super Étendard Modernisés. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long-term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993.[36][40] Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July–August 1992 and early the following year, at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier Foch in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerhervé, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993.[41]\n\nProduction and upgrades\n\nInitially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the Gulf War showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and reconnaissance missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet.[42] The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \"A\" and 139 \"B\" models\",[40][43] and later to 212 aircraft.[42] The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts.[40][42] Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns,[43] though the two-seater was later cancelled.[23]\n\nProduction of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007.[42] A further order of 59 F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004.[44] In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180.[45]\n\nDuring the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of Dassault Systèmes' CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional computer-aided design, manufacture and engineering software suite that would become standard across the industry.[46] CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as digital mockup and product data management. It consisted of 15 GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support.[46]\n\nThe Rafale final assembly site is located adjacent to Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport\n\nAccording to the French magazine L'Usine nouvelle, apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport. For example, the flight control surfaces are fabricated in Haute-Savoie, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in Val-d'Oise, and the engines in Essonne.[47] Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, Thales and Safran, who rely on a network of 500 subcontractors. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. As of 2012 , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft.[47]\n\nDeliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999.[48] Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board Charles de Gaulle; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the Gulf of Oman, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations.[49] In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training.[40]\n\nThe total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around €45.9 billion,[8] which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately €160.5 million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation.[50] The unit flyaway price as of 2010 was €101.1 million for the F3+ version.[51]\n\nIn 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch miniaturised satellites.[52] In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser-targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity.[53] In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced.[54][55]\n\nIn January 2014, Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that €1 billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018.[56][57] The Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later,[58] until replacement by the Franco-German New Generation Fighter.\n\nFuture replacement\n\nIn 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the New Generation Fighter. This fighter aircraft under development by Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defence and Space, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2035-40 timeframe.[59]\n\nDesign\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with active close-coupled canard to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from −3.6g to 9g (10.5g on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11g can be reached in case of emergency[60][61]). The Rafale is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft and uses digital fly-by-wire flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability.[61][N 2] The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to 115 knots (213 km/h; 132 mph); while in flight, airspeeds as low as 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) have been observed during training missions.[61] According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from STOBAR-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications.[63]\n\nThe Rafale M features a greatly reinforced undercarriage to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an arrestor hook, and \"jump strut\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including catapult launches.[36] It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based microwave landing system, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the inertial navigation system to external equipment.[39] Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) compared to other variants.[41] The Rafale M retains about 95 percent commonality with Air Force variants including,[64] although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of Charles de Gaulle, France's first nuclear-powered carrier, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, Foch and Clemenceau.[39]\n\nRadar signature\n\nS-duct air intake conceals jet engine blades from radar waves, and serrated patterns reduce frontal RCS\n\nAlthough not a full-aspect stealth aircraft, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) and infrared signature .[65][66] In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail-fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine air inlets underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of composite materials and serrated patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards.[58][65] Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite.[67] Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified.[62]\n\nCockpit\n\nThe Rafale's glass cockpit was designed around the principle of data fusion—a central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control.[68] The primary flight controls are arranged in a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed side-stick controller and a left-handed throttle.[69] The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29° to improve g-force tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view.[70] An intelligent flight suit worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.[71]\n\nGreat emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations.[62] Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated direct voice input (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls.[69] Developed by Crouzet, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and countermeasures systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions.[72] For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.[73]\n\nFor displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment.[74] Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of human–computer interaction (HCI).[13] A head-mounted display (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles.[69][75][76] The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG).[69]\n\nIn the area of life support, the Rafale is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mark 16F \"zero-zero\" ejection seat, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board oxygen generating system, developed by Air Liquide, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters.[77] The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The auto-pilot and autothrottle controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls.[69]\n\nAvionics and equipment\n\nThe Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface.[62][N 3] The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self-protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft.[78] The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters,[79] and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the Airbus A380.[80] According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life.[62]\n\nAnnotated diagram of SPECTRA 's elements\n\nThe Rafale features an integrated defensive-aids system named SPECTRA, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and MBDA.[81] Various methods of detection, jamming, and decoying have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub-systems in the future.[82][N 4] Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) platforms.[83]\n\nThe Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods,[84] such as Thales Optronics's Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and Damocles electro-optical/laser designation pod.[78] Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot.[85] Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's VHF/UHF secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a FLIR.[85]\n\nThe Damocles designation pod was described as \"lacking competitiveness\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and LITENING pods;[86] so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds.[87] A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show[88] and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018.[89] Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms.[90][N 5] Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.[85]\n\nRadar and sensors\n\nThe Rafale was first outfitted with the Thales RBE2 passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain-following and the real-time generation of high resolution ground maps for navigation and targeting.[91] In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months.[66] In September 2006, Flight International reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range.[92]\n\nThe RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200 km,[93] improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar.[94] A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway.[90] In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \"on time and on budget\").[94] By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013.[95]\n\nTo enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or Optronique Secteur Frontal (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and infrared wavelengths.[96] The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the MICA at beyond visual range distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea.[97] Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance.[91] In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally.[94]\n\nArmament and standards\n\nInitial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the F1 (\"France 1\") standard, these had been equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations.[98] Later deliveries were to the \"F2\" standard, which added the capability for conducting both air-to-ground and reconnaissance operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006.[99] Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s.[69][76]\n\nWeapons of the Rafale\n\nF3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air-to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using SCALP EG cruise missiles and AASM Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 Exocet sea skimming missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with ASMP-A missiles.[100] In 2010, France ordered 200 MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service.[101][102]\n\nThe F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.[103]\n\nFor compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with MIL-STD-1760, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment.[62] The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 hardpoints (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30 mm GIAT 30 revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions.[62] According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility.[62]\n\nEngines\n\nCloseup of the rear of the airframe and the two engine nozzles\n\nRafale B in a clean configuration\n\nThe Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to 50 kilonewtons (11,000 pounds-force) of dry thrust and 75 kN (17,000 lb f ) with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, and technology to reduce radar and infrared signatures.[62] The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.[104][105]\n\nQualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year.[106] Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine.[11][107] In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2.[108] The engine is of a modular design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard.[106] There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[109] As of 2007, a thrust vectoring variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development.[98]\n\nOperational history\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Naval Aviation\n\nIn December 2000, the French Naval Aviation (Aéronavale), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron Flottille 12F, which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale.[110] Flottille 12F immediately participated in Trident d'Or aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with warships from ten other nations. During the maritime exercise, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings.[110][111] After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004.[112]\n\nThe Rafale M is fully compatible with US Navy aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks.[113] On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on USS Harry S. Truman, a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier.[114]\n\nIn 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard Charles de Gaulle of the French Navy during \"Mission Héraclès\", the French participation in \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while Charles de Gaulle was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India-Pakistan border.[13][115]\n\nIn 2016, Rafales operating from Charles de Gaulle struck targets associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[116]\n\nIn December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while Charles de Gaulle undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions.[117] Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and 17F, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard USS George H.W. Bush for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at Naval Air Station Oceana.[118]\n\nFrench Air Force\n\nFormation of five Rafales making a flypast in 2006\n\nRafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the Centre d'Expériences Aériennes Militaires (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that Escadron de Chasse (Fighter Squadron) 1/7 at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8–10 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when EC 1/7 would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters).[112][119]\n\nIn 2007, after a \"crash program\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to Dushanbe in Tajikistan, while the three others were Rafale Marine of the Navy on board Charles De Gaulle.[120] The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first GBU-12 was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational début of the Rafale.[121] Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at Kandahar International Airport to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces.[122]\n\nOn 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and strike missions over Libya in Opération Harmattan, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of Benghazi.[123] The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead.[83] On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway.[124]\n\nDuring the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \"Hammer\" bombs, a Thales Damoclès targeting pod and two drop tanks;[83] these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft.[125] The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between 125 kilograms (280 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions.[125] Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow SCALP weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra.[126] In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground-attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the close air support role.[125]\n\nA French Air Force Rafale B during Operation Serval in Mali, 2013\n\nIn January 2013, the Rafale took part in \"Opération Serval\", the French military intervention in support to the government of Mali against the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa.[127] The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of Gao, eastern Mali.[128] Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from Timbuktu and Douentza.[129] Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali.[130]\n\nIn August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall.[131]\n\nIn September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of Opération Chammal, France's contribution to the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE.[132][133] On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zummar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.[134][135]\n\nIn April 2018, during the Syrian Civil War, five Rafale B fighters from the Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Each jet was loaded with two SCALP EG missiles.[136]\n\nEgypt\n\nIn November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement.[137] By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the Suez Canal expansion in August 2015.[138]\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales,[139] as part of a larger deal, including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and missiles, worth US$5.9 billion (€5.2 billion).[140][141] The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in Istres.[142] In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters.[143] All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force.[144] Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single-seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the Egyptian Air Force.[145] Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017.[146] The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales.[147]\n\nIn June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract.[148][149] An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations.[150]\n\nQatar\n\nA Qatari Rafale at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in 2019.\n\nStarting in 2011, the Qatar Emiri Air Force evaluated the Rafale alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Boeing F-15E, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace its Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales.[151] On 30 April 2015, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani announced to French President François Hollande that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft.[152] On 4 May, a €6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as €263M for each aircraft.[153][154] On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for €1.1 billion (or €92M each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters.[155] The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019.[156][157]\n\nIndia\n\nRafale of the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale.[158] In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against Su-30MKIs.[159] In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4 billion contract.[160] On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder.[161][162] It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under transfer of technology agreements.[163][164] The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion.[165][166]\n\nThe deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The Indian Defence Ministry instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft.[167][168] In May 2013, The Times of India reported that negotiations were \"back on track\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017.[169] Another point of contention was a provision where Dassault was to reinvest 50 percent of the deal's earnings into India's defence sectors, either through purchases or technological expertise.[170][171] In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL.[172] By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015.[173]\n\nA Rafale landing at Ambala Air Force Station on its first arrival in India on 29 July 2020.\n\nIn April 2015, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris, India requested the rapid delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition.[174][175] Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years.[176] India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015.[177] Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities.[178] In January 2016, the Indian government directed the Indian Navy to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters.[179] Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales.[180] On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed a €7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price.[181] The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years.[182] The deal includes weapons and spares, which included Meteor BVRAAM missiles.[183][184] India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China.[185]\n\nThe Indian National Congress raised an issue over Dassault partnering with Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence, now known as Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited(R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner; Gandhi alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence.[186][187] Party spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from ₹7.15 billion to ₹16 billion.[188] In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the Supreme Court for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal.[189][190]\n\nIn March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing MiG-21s and to counter Pakistan's newer F-16s.[191] Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart; it had tail number \"RB-001\" to mark IAF chief-designate Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria's role in the 2016 deal.[192]\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.[193]\n\nDelivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Airforce from France.[194]\n\nPotential operators\n\nAnalysts view the relatively quick series of 84[195] orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the Arab Spring and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East.[196]\n\nFinland\n\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[197]\n\nIn December 2015 Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the United States where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program.[198] The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.[199]\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) Mikoyan MiG-29, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.[200] In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region.[201][202]\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs.[203] A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated.[204] Although a leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds,[N 6] on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs.[206] Due to a referendum, this purchase never happened.\n\nIn March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35.[207][208] In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons.[209] In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at Payerne Air Base for comparison against other bids.[210]\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nIn 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles.[211] In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed.[212] However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Union Defence Force, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in November 2011 called the French offer \"uncompetitive and unworkable\";[213] France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6 billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale.[214] Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon[215] or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[216]\n\nThe newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait.[217] In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit.[218] In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft.[219] In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s.[220] In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales.[221] In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE.[222]\n\nOthers\n\nSpain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.[223]\n\nIn January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its air force.[224]\n\nFailed bids\n\nThe Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100 million (2010),[225] while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour.[226] The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate.[226] According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.[227]\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance offered economic and technology partnerships in its bid for the Rafale to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters starting in 2023 as part of the air combat capability successor program. Other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon and Lockheed Martin F-35.[228] On 25 October 2018, Belgium selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace around 54 F-16s; government officials stated that the decision came down to price and that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven valuation criteria\"; the total purchasing price for the aircraft and support until 2030 totaled €4 billion, €600 million cheaper than the initial budget of €4.6 billion.[229][230]\n\nBrazil\n\nIn June 2008, the Brazilian Air Force issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, Su-35, Gripen NG and Eurofighter Typhoon.[231] In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2 – Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F.[232] On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs.[233][234] In February 2011, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18.[235] After delays due to budget constraints,[236] in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5 billion deal to equip the air force.[237]\n\nCanada\n\nThe Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fleet.[238] In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions.[239] In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002.[240][241] In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin.[242] In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition.[243] Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35.[244] In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs.[245][246] In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community.[247][248]\n\nKuwait\n\nIn February 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales.[249] In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms.[250] Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests.[251] In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18–22 Rafales.[252] However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons.[253][254]\n\nLibya\n\nIn January 2007, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24 billion\".[255] In December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi declared Libya's interest in the Rafale,[256] but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international military intervention during the 2011 Libyan civil war.[257]\n\nSingapore\n\nIn 2005, the Republic of Singapore Air Force embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing A-4SU Super Skyhawks. A number of options were considered and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two – Dassault Rafale and the F-15SG Strike Eagle. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft.[258] According to Defense Industry Daily, one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration.[259]\n\nOthers\n\nIn 2002, the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F-15K Slam Eagle over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft F-X Phase 1 fighter competition.[260]\n\nDuring 2006, while there was potentially trouble with Anglo-American negotiations over the F-35 Lightning II, there was talk of purchasing the Rafale M for Britain's Royal Navy.[261] However, in May 2012, after having abandoned the F-35B STOVL version in favour of the F-35C CATOBAR variant in October 2010, the UK reverted to purchasing the F-35B.[262][263]\n\nIn late 2007, La Tribune reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead.[264][265] While French Defense Minister Herve Morin labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations.[265][266]\n\nIn February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of SEPECAT Jaguars.[267] In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons.[268][269]\n\nVariants\n\nRafale B/C and M\n\nRafale A Technology demonstrator, first flew in 1986.[11] Rafale D Dassault used this designation (D for discrète) in the early 1990s to emphasise the new semi-stealthy design features.[270] Rafale B F3-R Two-seater version for the French Air Force.[36] \"It can operate with the Talios targeting pod (45 ordered by French army will delivered between 2019 and 2023).\"[271] Rafale C F3-R Same as Rafale B F3-R but Single-seat version for the French Air Force.[36] Rafale M F3-R Same as Rafale C F3-R but Carrier-borne version for the French Naval Aviation, which entered service in 2001. For carrier operations, the M model has a strengthened airframe, longer nose gear leg to provide a more nose-up attitude, larger tailhook between the engines, and a built-in boarding ladder. Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg (1,100 lb) more than the Rafale C.[36][272] It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise.[273] Rafale N Originally called the Rafale BM, was a planned missile-only two-seater version for the Aéronavale.[49] Budgetary and technical constraints have been cited as grounds for its cancellation.[23] Rafale R Proposed reconnaissance-oriented variant.[65] Rafale DM Two-seater version for the Egyptian Air Force.[274] Rafale EM Single-seat version for the Egyptian Air Force.[275] Rafale DH Two-seater version for the Indian Air Force.[276] Rafale EH Single-seat version for the Indian Air Force.[6] Rafale B, C, M F4 ( first step 4.1, second step 4.2) It will upgrade radar (F4.1), as well as improved capabilities in the Helmet-Mounted Display and AASM 1000 kg, OSF (long range optoelectronics system) will be receive an IRST( Infrared Search and Track ) for detecting and identifying airborne stealth targets at long range (F4.1), it will be more effective in network-centric warfare, more data exchange and satellite communication and will launch small (F4.2) . It as be ordered in 2019.:All 180 French Rafale B,C,M will be upgraded to F4.1 in 2022 and F4.2 in 2027,[271][277] moreover a further 30 aircraft at the full F4 standard (F4.2) will be ordered in 2023 and delivered between 2027 and 2030.[278]\n\nOperators\n\nMap with Dassault Rafale operators in blue, with orders in cyan\n\nFrance A total of 180 have been ordered out of a planned 286, with an option for another 9.[76] Approximately 152 are confirmed to be delivered by 2018.[279][280] As of 2017 , 149 had been delivered. In 2018 three Rafale will be delivered, and then in 2024 all the 28 remaining out of the 180 ordered will be delivered.[276][281][282]\n\nEgyptian Air Force – 24 Rafales in service of the 24 ordered as of December 2018.[147][286]\n\nQatar Air Force – Qatar ordered 24 of the fighters in 2015, adding 12 more in 2018. It also has an option to buy 36 more.[290] As of February 2020, 23 were delivered.[291]\n\nNotable accidents\n\nOn 6 December 2007, a French Air Force twin-seat Rafale crashed during a training flight. The pilot, who suffered from spatial disorientation, was killed in the accident. [292]\n\nOn 24 September 2009, after unarmed test flights, two French Navy Rafales returning to the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, collided in mid-air about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the town of Perpignan in southwest France. One test pilot, identified as François Duflot, was killed in the accident, while the other was rescued.[293]\n\nSpecifications\n\nAASM-Hammer family of weapons\n\nMICA: short- to medium-range air-to-air missile\n\nData from Dassault Aviation,[294] Superfighters,[295] French Navy,[296] International Directory of Military Aircraft[297]\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nCrew: 1 or 2\n\n1 or 2 Length: 15.27 m (50 ft 1 in)\n\n15.27 m (50 ft 1 in) Wingspan: 10.90 m (35 ft 9 in)\n\n10.90 m (35 ft 9 in) Height: 5.34 m (17 ft 6 in)\n\n5.34 m (17 ft 6 in) Wing area: 45.7 m 2 (492 sq ft)\n\n45.7 m (492 sq ft) Empty weight: 10,300 kg (22,708 lb) (B)[69][294]\n\nGross weight: 15,000 kg (33,069 lb)\n\n15,000 kg (33,069 lb) Max takeoff weight: 24,500 kg (54,013 lb)\n\n24,500 kg (54,013 lb) Fuel capacity: 4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( C ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( B )\n\n4,700 kg (10,362 lb) internal for single-seater ( ); 4,400 kg (9,700 lb) for two-seater ( ) Maximum fuel: ( C ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) [ citation needed ]\n\n( ): 16,550 l (4,370 US gal; 3,640 imp gal) (5,750 l (1,520 US gal; 1,260 imp gal) internal + 2,300 l (610 US gal; 510 imp gal) in 2x conformal tanks + 8,500 l (2,200 US gal; 1,900 imp gal) in 5 drop tanks) Powerplant: 2 × Snecma M88-2 turbofans, 50.04 kN (11,250 lbf) thrust each [298] dry, 75 kN (17,000 lbf) with afterburner\n\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 2,223 km/h (1,381 mph, 1,200 kn) [299] / Mach 1.8[300] at high altitude\n\n1,390 km/h, 860 mph, 750 kn / Mach 1.1 at low altitude\n\nSupercruise: [301] Mach 1.4 [ citation needed ]\n\nMach 1.4 Combat range: 1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs.\n\n1,850 km (1,150 mi, 1,000 nmi) on penetration mission with three tanks (5,700 L), two SCALP-EG and two MICA AAMs. Ferry range: 3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks\n\n3,700 km (2,300 mi, 2,000 nmi) with 3 drop tanks Service ceiling: 15,835 m (51,952 ft)\n\n15,835 m (51,952 ft) g limits: + 9 − 3.6 ( + 11 in emergencies) [60] [302] [303]\n\n9 3.6 ( 11 in emergencies) Rate of climb: 304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min)\n\n304.8 m/s (60,000 ft/min) Wing loading: 328 kg/m 2 (67 lb/sq ft)\n\n328 kg/m (67 lb/sq ft) Thrust/weight: 0.988 (100% fuel, 2 EM A2A missile, 2 IR A2A missile) version B\n\nArmament\n\n\n\nAvionics\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nRelated lists\n\nNotes\n\n^ [16] Quote: \"Dassault demands design leadership as the price for European co-operation.\" ^ [62] Quote: \"Longitudinal stability is moderately negative with a full fly-by-wire digital control system.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854975"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale","text":"India has purchased 36 Rafale fighter jets in an inter-governmental deal with France.\n\nThe ability to strike air-to-air targets from up to 150 km away and safely hit land targets 300 km within enemy territory make India's Rafales some of the deadliest fighter jets flying in the world.\n\nKnown for air-superiority and precision strikes, the French-made Rafales are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.\n\nThe first five Rafales bought from France in a multi-billion-dollar deal landed in the country on Wednesday and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh used their arrival to launch a veiled warning to neighbouring China over territorial tensions.\n\n\"If it is anyone who should be worried about or critical about this new capability of the Indian Air Force, it should be those who want to threaten our territorial integrity,\" Mr Singh said.\n\nThe Rafales were greeted with a water-cannon guard of honour when they landed at the Ambala air base.\n\nIndian and Chinese forces were locked in a six-week-long standoff along their de-facto border that peaked with a hand-to-hand battle in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed last month. China also suffered casualties in the showdown but has not given figures.\n\nThe deadly clash has sharpened an intense nationwide spotlight on the combat jets that were greeted with a water-cannon guard of honour when they landed at the Ambala air base in Haryana.\n\nThe aircraft are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, SCALP cruise missiles and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.\n\nMeteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden. The Meteor is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, experts say.\n\nThe Meteor missile can target enemy aircraft from 150 km away. It can destroy enemy aircraft before they actually even get close to the Indian aircraft.\n\nHad India had this capability a day of during the aerial encounter with Pakistan last year, the assumption is that many Pakistani F-16s would have been destroyed.\n\nRafales are also equipped to carry SCALP cruise missiles that can hit targets 300 km away. It means that an Indian Air Force Rafale taking off from Ambala, will be able to launch one of these weapons from well within Indian airspace to hit a target deep inside China.\n\nThe third weapon system is the MICA missile system. The MICA is a very versatile air-to-air missile. It comes with a radar seeker. It also comes with an infrared seeker and the reason which makes it very advanced is that it can be fired for the short-range to your long-range as well right up to a 100 km.\n\nIt's already in service with the Indian Air Force is Mirages and is the primary weapon system of Rafales as well.\n\nThe five aircraft are being inducted into the Ambala-based No 17 Squadron, also known as the ''Golden Arrows''.\n\nThe Indian Air Force is also procuring new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets.\n\nHammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran. The missile was originally designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy.\n\nApart from weapons, Rafales also fly with SPECTRA - widely considered the world's most advanced fighter-based electronic warfare suite, a system which is the cornerstone of the Rafale's survivability against a host of the latest threats.\n\nSPECTRA is designed to detect threats and provides a multi-spectral threat warning capability against hostile radars, missiles and lasers. By detecting threats at long-range, SPECTRA allows the pilot to instantly select the best suited defensive measures combining radar jamming of ground and airborne radars and the deployment of infrared or radar decoying flares and chaff.\n\nThe fleet of five aircraft, comprising three single-seaters and two twin-seaters, are being inducted into the Indian Air Force as part of its Ambala-based No 17 Squadron, also known as the ''Golden Arrows''.\n\nIndia has also received five more jets which are currently in France for training missions. The delivery of all 36 aircraft as part of the deal is set to be completed on schedule by the end of 2021, the government has said.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)","title":"What Makes India's Rafale Fighter Jets So Potent Against China, Pakistan","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-news-what-makes-indias-rafale-fighter-jets-so-potent-against-china-pakistan-2271025","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-07/nsqa2k3o_rafale-stationary-iaf-_625x300_29_July_20.jpg"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f274164222e6eece6854979"},"channel":"Google","query":"Rafale","text":"The Indian Air Force (IAF) has much to cheer with the arrival of five Rafale omni-role fighter jets in terms of the technology and capability accretion that it brings. In the words of the Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria and former ACM B.S. Dhanoa, Rafale is a “game changer”.\n\nEncapsulating what the Rafales bring in, ACM Bhadauria said in February that at the time of the Kargil conflict in 1999, India had an edge over Pakistan in terms of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile capability. “We allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade-and-a-half of struggle in the acquisition process to be able to get better capability,” he said. The Rafale, armed with the Meteor BVR air-to-air missile, will restore that edge in the neighbourhood as there is no equivalent to it currently.\n\nAccording to its manufacturer Dassault Aviation, Rafale is an omni-role fighter capable of the entire spectrum of roles — air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. With its advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, electronic warfare suite and network-centric capabilities in addition to its armaments, Rafale is now the most advanced fighter in the IAF arsenal, overtaking the SU-30MKI, which is due for major upgrades.\n\nRafale is also the first imported fighter to join service in over two decades since the SU-30s in the late 1990s. Rafale has 14 hard points for weapons and can carry a total external load of over 9 tonnes. In addition to the Meteor, it is armed with SCALP long-range stand-off attack air-to-ground missiles and MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles. The latest addition, HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) medium range air-to-ground missiles, is being procured through the emergency route.\n\nAnother significant factor with the Rafales is that as per contract, at least 75% of the Rafale fleet has to be operationally available, which would make it the most available fighter in the IAF fleet. The first Rafale squadron, No. 17 Golden Arrows, will be based at Ambala and the second squadron will be at Hasimara. All 36 aircraft will be delivered on schedule by end 2021, the Indian Embassy in France said last week.\n\nThe €7.87 billion (₹59,262 crore) inter-governmental agreement, signed in September 2016 between India and France for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition, also includes 13 India-Specific Enhancements (ISE), the non-recurring design and development cost of which is ₹9,855 crore. Some of them pertain to radar enhancements, helmet mounted display, ability to start and operate from high altitude airfields, advanced infrared search and track sensor and a very potent electronic jammer pod.\n\nThe deal also epitomises the cumbersome defence procurement process in which government-to-government deals have of late become the way out. Rafale was originally selected under the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft tender issued in 2007, which itself was conceived as a Mig-21 replacement project in early 2000s. Rafale was selected in 2012 but negotiations got stuck due to differences and the tender was eventually withdrawn after the emergency purchase announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April 2015, citing “critical operational necessity” of the IAF.\n\nFalling numbers\n\nHowever, the 36 Rafales will do little to arrest the falling numbers of fighter squadrons of the IAF, which has a sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons but is down to 31 at present. To offset that, the IAF is banking on the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). A contract for 83 LCA-Mk1A is in final stages and they are in addition to the 40 jets already contracted for. A more advanced LCA-Mk2 is also in the works. The government has recently approved the procurement of 21 MIG-29 jets from Russia, which will add two additional squadrons. In addition, 12 SU-30MKI aircraft have also been approved, which will replenish the numbers of Sukhois lost in crashes. The IAF will also phase out five squadrons of Mig-21s in the the next few years.\n\nWhile the IAF works to keep the numbers from falling further, the Rafale, which joins the IAF at a time of unprecedented tensions on the border with China, will give a qualitative edge to the force in the region.","title":"Rafale jets | The ‘game-changer’ fighters","author":["Law In Question Is Unconstitutional","Rooted In Colonialism","They Say","In The Past Months","They Were Done Primarily Through Embassies"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-jets-the-game-changer-fighters/article32249724.ece","image":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l9uzfv/article32249721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-RAFALE-1"}

It can be used to perform ground and sea attacks, reconnaissance, high-accuracy strikes and nuclear strike deterrence.\n\nThe aircraft was developed for the French Navy and French Air Force.\n\nThe fighter aircraft was used in combat operations in various nations, including Afghanistan, Mali, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Egypt, Qatar and India also ordered the aircraft.\n\nRafale combat aircraft was exhibited at Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) Exhibition in March 2019.\n\nFrance’s airforce and navy ordered 180 (132 for the airforce and 48 for the navy) and 152 aircraft were delivered by January 2019. The manufacturer is expected to resume the delivery of the remaining 28 aircraft in 2022.\n\nThe Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and the French Air Force in 2006. Ten aircraft are operational on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier.\n\nThe State of Qatar signed a contract with Dassault Aviation to acquire 24 Rafale fighters in May 2015. The $7bn contract also includes an option for 12 additional fighters and the option was exercised by Qatar in December 2017. The company started the deliveries, with the first Rafale delivered to the Qatari Emiri Air Force in February 2019.\n\nThe French defence procurement agency (DGA) qualified the Rafale F3-R standard in October 2018. The F3-R is an advanced version of Rafale F3 standard with improved versatility. In March 2017, the French Government approved the development of new advanced Rafale F4 standard.\n\nThe company received the development contract for the Rafale F4 standard aircraft in January 2019. The validation of the latest standard is expected in 2024.\n\nRafale fighter aircraft development\n\nRafale B and C entered service with the French Air Force in June 2006, when the first squadron was established. The second airforce squadron was set up in 2008. A €3.1bn ($3.89bn) contract to develop the fully capable F3 standard aircraft was awarded to Dassault Aviation (€1.5bn), Snecma (€600m), Thales (€500m) and other French contractors by the French Ministry of Defence in February 2004.\n\nAn order for 59 F3 aircraft, 47 for the airforce (11 two-seat and 36 single-seat) and 12 (single-seat) for the navy, was placed in December 2004. The Rafale F3 was certified in July 2008. The contract also includes upgrades of the Rafale F2 aircraft.\n\nThe first Rafale F3 was delivered to the French Air Force in 2008. In March 2007, three French Air Force and three navy Rafale fighters were deployed in Tajikistan in support of the Nato International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.\n\nThe French Government ordered 60 additional Rafale aircraft in November 2009. Brazil’s Government awarded a $4bn contract to Dassault Aviation in January 2010 to supply 36 Rafale multirole aircraft.\n\nThe UAE was expected to acquire the Rafale under a $10bn contract to replace its 60 ageing Mirage fighters. In November 2011, however, the deal came to a standstill when the UAE termed Dassault’s price and terms as ‘uncompetitive’. The country is also considering Eurofighter’s Typhoon to replace its ageing Mirage fighters.\n\nIn February 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence selected Rafale for the Indian Air Force’s MMRCA (medium multirole combat aircraft) programme. The contract is worth approximately $20bn.\n\nRafale emerged as the preferred aircraft among various contenders for what is being called the biggest military aviation contract in the world. Its closest contender was Eurofighter’s Typhoon.\n\nUnder the contract, Dassault will supply 126 Rafale fighters. The first 18 fighters will be supplied by 2015 and the rest will be manufactured in India under a technology transfer to Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL). This contract will be the first international supply for Rafale.\n\nThe Indian Government finalised a contract in April 2015 for the acquisition of 36 (28 single-seat and eight dual-seat) Rafale aircraft. An intergovernmental deal worth €7.87bn ($8.82bn) was signed to facilitate the purchase in September 2016. France delivered the first aircraft to India in October 2019.\n\nDassault Aviation signed a sales contract with the Arab Republic of Egypt in February 2015 for the supply of 24 Rafale fighter aircraft. It completed the delivery of the 24th aircraft in July 2019.\n\nCockpit of Dassault’s Rafale Multirole Combat Fighter\n\nThe cockpit has hands-on throttle and stick control (HOTAS). The cockpit is equipped with a heads-up, wide-angle holographic display from Thales Avionique, which provides aircraft control data, mission data and firing cues.\n\nA collimated, multi-image head-level display presents tactical situation and sensor data, while two touchscreen lateral displays show the aircraft system parameters and mission data.\n\nThe pilot also has a helmet-mounted sight and display. A CCD camera and on-board recorder records the image of the head-up display throughout the mission.\n\nRafale fighter weapons\n\nRafale can carry payloads of more than 9t on 14 hardpoints for the airforce version, with 13 for the naval version. The range of weapons includes: Mica, Magic, Sidewinder, ASRAAM and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles; Apache, AS30L, ALARM, HARM, Maverick and PGM100 air-to-ground missiles and Exocet / AM39, Penguin 3 and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\n\nFor a strategic mission the Rafale can deliver the MBDA (formerly Aerospatiale) ASMP stand-off nuclear missile. In December 2004, the MBDA Storm Shadow / Scalp EG stand-off cruise missile was qualified on the Rafale.\n\nIn September 2005, the first flight of the MBDA Meteor BVRAAM beyond visual range air-to-air missile was conducted on a Rafale fighter. In December 2005, successful flight trials were carried out from the Charles de Gaulle of the range of Rafale’s weapon systems, Exocet, Scalp-EG, Mica, ASMP-A (to replace the ASMP) and Meteor missiles.\n\nIn April 2007, the Rafale carried out the first firing of the Sagem AASM precision-guided bomb, which has both GPS / inertial guidance and, optionally, imaging infrared terminal guidance. Rafale have been equipped with the AASM from 2008. Rafale can carry six AASM missiles, with each aiming to hit the target with 10m accuracy.\n\nThe Rafale has a twin gun pod and a Nexter (formerly Giat) 30mm DEFA 791B cannon, which can fire 2,500 rounds a minute. The Rafale is equipped with laser designation pods for laser guidance of air-to-ground missiles.\n\nCountermeasure and sensor technology on the twin-jet combat aircraft\n\nRafale’s electronic warfare system is the Spectra from Thales. Spectra incorporates solid state transmitter technology, a DAL laser warning receiver, missile warning, detection systems and jammers.\n\nThe Rafale multirole combat fighter is equipped with an RBE2 passive electronically scanned radar developed by Thales, which has look-down and shoot-down capabilities. The radar can track up to eight targets simultaneously and provides threat identification and prioritisation.\n\nThales developed an active electronically scanned version of the RBE2, which equipped the Rafale in February 2011. Flight tests of the radar onboard the Rafale took place in 2008.\n\nRUAG Aviation was awarded a $5m contract by Thales in May 2009 to produce sub-assemblies for the RBE2 radar to be equipped on the Rafale fighter jet.\n\nOptronic systems include the Thales / SAGEM OSF infrared search and track system, installed in the nose of the aircraft. The optronic suite carries out search, target identification, telemetry and automatic target discrimination and tracking.\n\nIn January 2012, the French Ministry of Defence awarded a ten-year contract to Thales to maintain the electronic systems and warfare of the aircraft.\n\nNavigation and communications of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale\n\nThe communications suite on the Rafale uses the Saturn onboard very/ultra-high frequency (V/UHF) radio, which is a second-generation, anti-jam tactical UHF radio for NATO. Saturn provides voice encryption in fast-frequency hopping mode.\n\nThe aircraft is also equipped with fixed-frequency VHF / UHF radio for communications with civil air traffic control. A multifunction information distribution system (MIDS) terminal provides secure, high-data-rate tactical data exchange with NATO C2 stations, AWACS aircraft or naval ships.\n\nThe Rafale multirole combat fighter is powered by two M88-2 engines, each providing a thrust of 75kN.\n\nRafale is equipped with a Thales TLS 2000 navigation receiver, which is used for the approach phase of flight. TLS 2000 integrates the instrument landing system (ILS), microwave landing system (MLS) and VHF omni-directional radio-ranger (VOR) and marker functions.\n\nThe radar altimeter is the AHV 17 altimeter from Thales, which is suitable for very low flight. The Rafale has a TACAN tactical air navigation receiver for en-route navigation and as a landing aid.\n\nThe Rafale has an SB25A combined interrogator-transponder developed by Thales. The SB25A is the first IFF using electronic scanning technology.\n\nRafale Multirole Combat Fighter engines\n\nThe Rafale is powered by two M88-2 engines from SNECMA, each providing a thrust of 75kN. The aircraft is equipped for buddy-buddy refuelling with a flight refuelling hose reel and drogue pack. The first M88 engine was delivered in 1996. It is a twin-shaft bypass turbofan engine principally suitable for low-altitude penetration and high-altitude interception missions.\n\nThe M88 incorporates the latest technologies such as single-piece bladed compressor disks (blisks), an on-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal high-pressure turbine blades, powder metallurgy disks, ceramic coatings and composite materials.\n\nThe M88 engine comprises a three-stage LP compressor with inlet guide vane, an annular combustion chamber, single-stage cooled HP turbine, single-stage cooled LP turbine, radial A/B chamber, variable-section convergent flap-type nozzle and full authority digital engine control (FADEC).\n\nMessier-Dowty provides ‘jumper’ landing gear, designed to springout when the aircraft is catapulted by the nose gear strut.","title":"Rafale Multirole Combat Fighter, France","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/rafale-multirole-combat-fighter/","image":"https://www.airforce-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/Image-1-Rafale-Multirole-Combat-Fighter.jpg"}

All the 36 jets will be delivered to India by the end of 2021.\n\nRafales Introduced in 2001, the Rafale is a French twin-engine and multirole fighter aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy.\n\nand being produced for both the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in the French Navy. India has inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal in 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify.\n\nThe MMRCA deal was stalled due to disagreements over production in India. In comparison to the earlier deal i.e. MMRCA, Rafale has much technological advancement, lower life cycle cost and specifications according to the warfare needs of India.\n\nafter a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify. Specification Air Supremacy: Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction (act of disrupting), aerial reconnaissance (observation to locate an enemy), ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions.\n\nEquipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction (act of disrupting), aerial reconnaissance (observation to locate an enemy), ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. Wide Range of Weapons: Meteor missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.\n\nMeteor: It is the next generation of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat.\n\nThe Meteor missile can target enemy aircraft from 150 km away. It can destroy enemy aircraft before they actually even get close to the Indian aircraft. SCALP Cruise Missiles: It can hit targets 300 km away. MICA Missile System: It is a very versatile air-to-air missile. It comes with a radar seeker and can be fired for the short-range to long-range as well right up to 100 km.\n\nIt's already in service with the IAF i.e. Mirages and is the primary weapon system of Rafales as well.\n\nwill be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets. Air to Air Target: The ability to strike air-to-air targets from up to 150 km away and safely hit land targets 300 km within enemy territory make them some of the deadliest fighter jets flying in the world.\n\nThe ability to strike from up to 150 km away and safely hit land targets 300 km within enemy territory make them some of the deadliest fighter jets flying in the world. Flight Hours: The aircraft has 30,000 flight hours in operations.\n\nKey Points\n\nSignificance For India:\n\nJoint Strategic Vision: The Rafale would be an aid to the Joint Strategic Vision of India-France Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region to curb over-flights and the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the area. Upgradation of Air Combat Capabilities: It will significantly bolster India's air combat capabilities especially when it is facing hostile neighbours like Pakistan and China. Unmatched Capabilities: The aircraft proved its unmatched capabilities in air combat missions in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria in the last few years.\n\nIndia is the fourth country to have the strategic platform with Rafale after France, Egypt and Qatar. The Indian Air Force is also in the process of procuring a new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets. The Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran. Game Changer: Rafales could be a game-changer for India after all the 36 jets join the Indian Air Force as no aircraft in possession of any country in the neighbourhood will be able to match their superior kinematic performance and powerful electronic warfare systems.\n\nThe Rafale jet is often compared with the USA stealth F-35 aircraft and F-22. Border Clash with China: It is much more advanced and lethal than the current fighter aircraft available with China i.e.jet J-20. Therefore, it is definitely a boost to India's defence preparedness especially at the times of border clash with China.\n\nRelated Concerns: The induction of Rafale aircraft will be a game changer in many ways, however, it may not make up for the challenges faced by the Indian Air Force in near future:\n\nIAF’s Depleting Strength of Fighter Jets: The emergency acquisition was made primarily to check the depleting combat capability of the IAF as the number of its fighter squadrons had come down to a worrying 31 against the authorised strength of at least 42.\n\nAt present, its fleet comprises 30 squadrons of fighter jets. Therefore, one of main focus areas is to build up the authorised strength of fighter squadrons at the earliest. Increasing Potential of Hostile Neighbours: By 2023 the Pakistan Air Force will have 27 fighter squadrons while China’s PLA Air Force is assessed to have the capacity to bear at least 42 squadrons against India.\n\nHence, India can not lose sight of the developments in the North and West, with both the adversaries i.e. China and Pakistan are continuously increasing and upgrading their inventories. Two Front Challenge: Even though the IAF desires a strength of 45 fighter squadrons for a two-front challenge ( War with China and Pakistan), the last time it had its authorised complement of 42 squadrons was in 2002 after the terror attack on Parliament.\n\nSince then, the numbers have steadily fallen, and the trend will continue with five squadrons of old Russian MiG aircraft getting decommissioned subsequently. Delay of Supplies: The IAF has planned to procure Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk I and MK II from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). However, the supplies from HAL are behind the scheduled induction plan.\n\nSimilarly, IAF issued a request for information for 114 multirole fighters in June 2018 to foreign manufacturers i.e. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus Defence and Space, Russian Aircraft Corporation and Sukhoi Company. It plans to induct the aircraft within 12 years of the contract. However a request for proposal is awaited. Issues with Russia: The 12 Su-30MKIs, lost in accidents, are also being replenished by HAL through a contract with Russia, which has been approved by the government.\n\nHowever, the Russian connection is also limited as the IAF had earlier pulled out of the collaborative venture with Sukhoi to develop the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) after 11 years, citing disagreements over cost sharing plans, technology transfers and the test aircraft’s technological capabilities.\n\nThe induction of Rafale aircraft will be a game changer in many ways, however, it may not make up for the in near future:\n\nWay Forward\n\nAssimilation of Rafale has the capability to boost the defence sector of India. For the same there is need for the constant dialogue mechanism between India and France to further enhance its strategic and military ties.\n\nbetween India and France to further enhance its strategic and military ties. Meanwhile, India must procure 21 MiG-29 aircraft from Russia which would be inducted into service as an additional squadron. Along with the same, IAF must strive towards replenishing the old fighter aircrafts.\n\nwhich would be inducted into service as an additional squadron. Along with the same, IAF must strive towards replenishing the old fighter aircrafts. The fitting of additional India-specific enhancements in Rafale is a necessary aspect which must be done through exchange of technological intervention with France.\n\nSource: IE\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","title":"Induction of French Rafale Aircrafts in IAF","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/induction-of-french-rafale-aircrafts-in-iaf","image":"https://www.drishtiias.com/drishti/img/drishti_eng_200.png"}

Four aircraft will come for sure while an attempt is being made to ensure that a total of six jets come,” said a source.\n\nAccording to sources, the jets can be deployed for combat quicker than anticipated as France has diverted some of the game-changing missiles — Meteor and SCALP — meant for its own air force to the Rafale jets for India. Originally, this was supposed to happen months after the delivery of the fighter jets.\n\nThePrint had first reported on 20 March that the delivery of the Rafale fighter jets could get delayed from its original May date due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On 14 April, ThePrint reported that the delivery will take place only in July.\n\nAlso read: If you don’t shoot, you don’t escalate: NSAB chief explains how India, China have avoided war\n\nWill fly via UAE, with two mid-air refuellers\n\nAccording to the plan, the Rafale jets will take off from Istres in France and fly to the French airbase in Al Dhafra near Abu Dhabi in the UAE.

It will have a halt for the night and next day fly to Ambala,” another source told ThePrint.\n\nThe initial plan was that the aircraft would arrive after layovers in multiple countries. However, the Covid pandemic meant that the pilots would have to undergo quarantine at each base, said the sources.\n\nIt has now been decided that two French Airbus mid-air refuellers will fly with the jets. There would be at least two rounds of mid-air refuelling on the way to UAE, the sources said.\n\nIndian mid-air refuellers will take charge the next day for the journey to Ambala. Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots are now getting trained in France for refuelling. This was not part of the original training, said the sources.\n\nFrance diverts missiles to IAF\n\nThe contract India and France signed in September 2016 had said the Rafale delivery would take place in May 2020, and the main weapons package would arrive in October, said the sources.\n\nHowever, following a request, France has diverted the missiles made for its air force to India. These have started arriving already.\n\nThese missiles include the beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile, Meteor, which has the capability to hit targets over 120 km away, and the long range air-to-ground stand-off cruise missile, SCALP, which can strike targets 600 km away.\n\n“This means that the Rafale could be combat-ready much earlier than expected. The Meteor and SCALP have already been integrated with the Rafales which are coming in,” another source said.\n\nThe integration of Meteor into the Rafale weapons system means an Indian Rafale would be able to shoot down an enemy aircraft over 100 km away without even crossing the Indian air space.\n\nThe 5.1-metre-long SCALP can be carried in either one missile or two missiles configuration on the Rafale. Its inclusion means Indian Rafales would not have to cross the Indian airspace to hit a target that is about 600 km in enemy territory.\n\nAlso read: Kargil hero Col Wangchuk says need strong political will to strengthen India’s borders\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.
