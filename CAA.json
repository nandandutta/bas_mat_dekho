It had cleared the lower house two days earlier.\n\nThe bill has already prompted widespread protests in the north-east of the country which borders Bangladesh, as many people there say they will be \"overrun\" by immigrants from across the border.\n\nWhat does the bill say?\n\nThe CAB amends the 64-year-old Indian Citizenship law, which currently prohibits illegal migrants from becoming Indian citizens.\n\nIt defines illegal immigrants as foreigners who enter India without a valid passport or travel documents, or stay beyond the permitted time. Illegal immigrants can be deported or jailed.\n\nThe new bill also amends a provision which says a person must have lived in India or worked for the federal government for at least 11 years before they can apply for citizenship.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hindu refugees from Pakistan in a refugee camp in Jammu\n\nNow there will be an exception for members of six religious minority communities - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian - if they can prove that they are from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. They will only have to live or work in India for six years to be eligible for citizenship by naturalisation, the process by which a non-citizen acquires the citizenship or nationality of that country.\n\nIt also says people holding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards - an immigration status permitting a foreign citizen of Indian origin to live and work in India indefinitely - can lose their status if they violate local laws for major and minor offences and violations.\n\nWhy is the bill controversial?\n\nOpponents of the bill say it is exclusionary and violates the secular principles enshrined in the constitution. They say faith cannot be made a condition of citizenship.\n\nThe constitution prohibits religious discrimination against its citizens, and guarantees all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.\n\nDelhi-based lawyer Gautam Bhatia says that by dividing alleged migrants into Muslims and non-Muslims, the bill \"explicitly and blatantly seeks to enshrine religious discrimination into law, contrary to our long-standing, secular constitutional ethos\".\n\nHistorian Mukul Kesavan says the bill is \"couched in the language of refuge and seemingly directed at foreigners, but its main purpose is the delegitimisation of Muslims' citizenship\".\n\nCritics say that if it is genuinely aimed at protecting minorities, the bill should have have included Muslim religious minorities who have faced persecution in their own countries - Ahmadis in Pakistan and Rohingyas in Myanmar, for example. (The government has gone to the Supreme Court seeking to deport Rohingya refugees from India.)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDefending the bill, senior BJP leader Ram Madhav said, \"no country in the world accepts illegal migration\".\n\n\"For all others about whom the bleeding hearts are complaining, Indian citizenship laws are there. Naturalised citizenship is an option for others who legally claim Indian citizenship. All other illegal [immigrants] will be infiltrators,\" he added.\n\nAlso defending the bill earlier this year, R Jagannathan, editorial director of Swarajya magazine, wrote that \"the exclusion of Muslims from the ambit of the bill's coverage flows from the obvious reality that the three countries are Islamist ones, either as stated in their own constitutions, or because of the actions of militant Islamists, who target the minorities for conversion or harassment\".\n\nWhat is the history of the bill?\n\nThe Citizen Amendment Bill was first put before parliament in July 2016.\n\nThe legislation cleared parliament's lower house where the BJP has a large majority, but it did not pass in the upper house, after violent anti-migrant protests in north-eastern India.\n\nThe protests were particularly vocal in Assam state, which in August saw two million residents left off a citizens' register. Illegal migration from Bangladesh has long been a concern in the state.\n\nThe CAB is seen as being linked to the register, although it is not the same thing.\n\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh became an independent country.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The government says the National Register of Citizens is needed to identify illegal migrants\n\nIn the run-up to its publication, the BJP had supported the NRC, but changed tack days before the final list was published, saying it was error-ridden.\n\nThe reason for that was a lot of Bengali Hindus - a strong voter base for the BJP - were also left out of the list, and would possibly become illegal immigrants.\n\nHow is the citizens' register linked to the bill?\n\nThe two are closely linked, because the Citizenship Amendment Bill will help protect non-Muslims who are excluded from the register and face the threat of deportation or internment.\n\nThis means tens of thousands of Bengali Hindu migrants who were not included in the NRC can still get citizenship to stay on in Assam state.\n\nLater, Home Minister Amit Shah proposed a nationwide register of citizens to ensure that \"each and every infiltrator is identified and expelled from India\" by 2024.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Right-wing groups have protested against Rohingya refugees living in India\n\n\"If the government goes ahead with its plan of implementing the nationwide NRC, then those who find themselves excluded from it will be divided into two categories: (predominantly) Muslims, who will now be deemed illegal migrants, and all others, who would have been deemed illegal migrants, but are now immunised by the Citizenship Amendment Bill if they can show that their country of origin is Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan,\" Mr Bhatia said.\n\nTaken together, the NRC and CAB have the \"potential of transforming India into a majoritarian polity with gradations of citizenship rights,\" said sociologist Niraja Gopal Jaya.","title":"Citizenship Amendment Bill: India's new 'anti-Muslim' law explained","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50670393","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FD72/production/_110028846_gettyimages-1183874358-594x594.jpg"}

The fundamental criticism of the Bill has been that it specifically targets Muslims.\n\nThe government intends to introduce The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament’s Winter Session that commences on Monday and is scheduled to continue until December 13. What is this Bill, and why is it contentious?\n\nWhat is The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?\n\nThe Bill seeks to amend The Citizenship Act, 1955 to make Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, eligible for citizenship of India. In other words, the Bill intends to make it easier for non-Muslim immigrants from India’s three Muslim-majority neighbours to become citizens of India.\n\nUnder The Citizenship Act, 1955, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have resided in India during the last 12 months, as well as for 11 of the previous 14 years.\n\nThe amendment relaxes the second requirement from 11 years to 6 years as a specific condition for applicants belonging to these six religions, and the aforementioned three countries.\n\nExplained: What NRC+CAA means to you?\n\nUnder The Citizenship Act, 1955, a person who is born in India, or has Indian parentage, or has resided in India over a specified period of time, is eligible for Indian citizenship.\n\nIllegal migrants cannot become Indian citizens. Under the Act, an illegal migrant is a foreigner who: (i) enters the country without valid travel documents like a passport and visa, or (ii) enters with valid documents, but stays beyond the permitted time period.\n\nIllegal migrants may be put in jail or deported under The Foreigners Act, 1946 and The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.\n\nHowever, in 2015 and 2016, the government exempted specified groups of illegal migrants from provisions of the 1946 and 1920 Acts. They were Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who reached India on or before December 31, 2014.\n\nThis meant that these particular categories of illegal migrants would not be deported or jailed for being in India without valid documents.\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in Parliament to amend The Citizenship Act, 1955, so that these people could be made eligible for citizenship of India.\n\nWhat happened with the Bill?\n\nThe Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha on July 19, 2016, and was referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on August 12, 2016. The Committee submitted its report on January 7, 2019 and, the following day (January 8, 2019), the Bill was passed in Lok Sabha.\n\nWith the 16th Lok Sabha nearing the end of its term, the government was racing against time to introduce it in Rajya Sabha. However, massive protests against the Bill in the Northeast acted to restrain the government, and Rajya Sabha adjourned sine die on February 13, 2019, without the Bill being tabled.\n\nAccording to Parliamentary procedures, all Bills that have been passed by Lok Sabha but not by Rajya Sabha lapse when the term of Lok Sabha ends. The relevant provision in the Legislative Procedure in the Rajya Sabha says: “A Bill pending in Rajya Sabha which has not been passed by Lok Sabha does not lapse on the dissolution of Lok Sabha but a Bill which is passed by Lok Sabha and is pending in Rajya Sabha lapses on the dissolution of Lok Sabha.” (Procedure regarding Bills originating in Lok Sabha and transmitted to Rajya Sabha: Provision regarding lapsing of Bills.\n\nThe Citizenship Amedment Bill too, therefore, lapsed.\n\nThe Bill is now likely to be introduced afresh in the Winter Session. It will have to be passed by both Houses in order to become a law.\n\nWhat is the controversy around the Bill?\n\nThe fundamental criticism of the Bill has been that it specifically targets Muslims. Critics argue that it is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality.\n\nThe government, however, maintains that the Bill aims to grant citizenship to minorities who have faced religious persecution in Muslim-majority foreign countries. BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have spoken of this Bill as righting the wrongs of history by granting refuge to the sons and daughters of “Ma Bharti”, who were left stranded by Partition.\n\nIn the Northeastern states, the prospect of citizenship for massive numbers of illegal Bangladeshi migrants has triggered deep anxieties, including fears of demographic change, loss of livelihood opportunities, and erosion of the indigenous culture.\n\nAlmost the entire Northeast was wracked by massive protests for more than a month leading up to the anticipated introduction of the Bill in Rajya Sabha earlier this year.\n\nThe BJP has, however, always underlined its determination to bring in the Bill.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah has linked the passage of the Bill with a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), suggesting that even if the Assam NRC erred in leaving out some non-Muslims, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill would fix the error.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It offer citizenship to these six identified non-Muslim minorities who reportedly fled from India’s neighbouring countries due to ‘religious persecution’.\n\nThis aims to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, which did not allow citizenship to any kind of illegal migrants.

Though the Bill doesn't spell it out clearly, but the fact that it entitles Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians facing religious persecution in the three nations, to seek Indian citizenship, highlights the exclusion of Muslims.\n\nThis amendment is of the Citizenship Act, 1955 which requires the applicant to have resided in India for 11 of the previous 14 years. The amendment relaxes this requirement from 11 years to six years, for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians from the three nations.\n\nWho stands to benefit?\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act grants citizenship to the Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis — from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who had arrived in India before 31 December 2014.\n\nTo put it simply, those belonging to these religions, coming in from the three countries stand a chance to become Indian, even if they don't have requisite documents. Moreover, they will not be deported for not having documents.\n\nAlso, the requirement for them to stay in India for at least 11 years before applying for Indian citizenship has been reduced to five years.\n\nWhy the protests?\n\nThere are two kinds of protests that are taking place across India right now, against the Act. In the northeast, the protest is against the Act's implementation in their areas. Most of them fear that if implemented, the Act will cause a rush of immigrants that may alter their demographic and linguistic uniqueness.\n\nIn the rest of India, like in Kerala, West Bengal and in Delhi, people are protesting against the exclusion of Muslims, alleging it to be against the ethos of the Constitution.\n\nThe exclusions\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act does not apply to tribal areas of Tripura, Mizoram, Assam and Meghalaya because of being included in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Also areas that fall under the Inner Limit notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, will also be outside the Act's purview. This keeps almost entire Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland out of the ambit of the Act.\n\nNRC link to the controversial Act\n\nThe NRC, which identified and eliminated illegal immigrants from Assam on Supreme Court orders, had been a longstanding demand of Assam. But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah raised the pitch for this during his election rallies.\n\nAs late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. He had said: \"We had brought the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha, but the TMC MPs did not allow the Upper House to function. They did not allow the bill to be passed, and due to this, there are people in our country who are yet to get Indian citizenship.\"\n\nBut, what happened in Assam after the NRC implementation. After the updated final NRC in Assam was released on August 31 this year, it excluded the names of over 19 lakh applicants including Hindus. Now, the CAB will ensure they are not harmed.\n\nIn another rally in Bengal in April, Shah had given a peek into his larger plan, \"After passing the Bill, we would bring the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, so that all the refugees get citizenship, and then we will bring the NRC to throw out each and every infiltrator.\"\n\nAs of now, the protests, some of them violent, have created a law and order situation. But even as the northeast and the rest of India join in the protests against the Act, the purpose of their protests are very different from each other.\n\nSubscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nShare Via\n\nClick here to read the Mint ePaperLivemint.com is now on Telegram.

It amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities, who had fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014.[3][4] Muslims from those countries were not given such eligibility.[5][6][7] The act was the first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[7][a][b][c]\n\nThe Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the Indian government,[8][9] had promised in previous election manifestos to offer Indian citizenship to members of persecuted religious minorities who had migrated from neighbouring countries.[10][11] Under the 2019 amendment, migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, and had suffered \"religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\" in their country of origin were made eligible for citizenship.[4] The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalisation of these migrants from twelve years to six.[12] According to Intelligence Bureau records, there will be just over 30,000 immediate beneficiaries of the bill.[13][d]\n\nThe amendment has been widely criticised as discriminating on the basis of religion, particularly for excluding Muslims.[5][6] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called it \"fundamentally discriminatory\", adding that while India's \"goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome\", this should be accomplished through a non-discriminatory \"robust national asylum system\".[17] Critics express concerns that the bill would be used, along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to render many Muslim citizens stateless, as they may be unable to meet stringent birth or identity proof requirements.[18][19] Commentators also question the exclusion of persecuted religious minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.[18][20] The Indian government says that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh have Islam as their state religion and therefore Muslims are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\" there.[11][21] However, certain Muslim groups, such as Hazaras and Ahmadis, have historically faced persecution in these countries.[22][23][24]\n\nThe passage of the legislation caused large-scale protests in India.[25] Assam and other northeastern states have seen violent demonstrations against the bill over fears that granting Indian citizenship to refugees and immigrants will cause a loss of their \"political rights, culture and land rights\" and motivate further migration from Bangladesh.[26][27][28] In other parts of India, protesters said the bill discriminated against Muslims and demanded that Indian citizenship to be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants.[29] Major protests against the Act were held at universities in India. Students at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia alleged brutal suppression by the police.[30] The protests have led to the deaths of several protesters, injuries to protesters and police personnel, damage to public and private property, the detention of hundreds of people, and suspensions of local internet mobile phone connectivity in certain areas.[31][32] Some states have announced they will not implement the Act. The Union Home Ministry has said that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of the CAA.[33]\n\nBackground\n\nCitizenship law\n\nThe Indian Constitution that was implemented in 1950 guaranteed citizenship to all of the country's residents at the commencement of the constitution, and made no distinction on the basis of religion.[34][35] The Indian government passed the Citizenship Act in 1955. The Act provided two means for foreigners to acquire Indian citizenship. People from \"undivided India\"[e] were given a means of registration after seven years of residency in India. Those from other countries were given a means of naturalisation after twelve years of residency in India.[39] Political developments in the 1980s, particularly those related to the violent Assam movement against all migrants from Bangladesh, triggered revisions to the Citizenship Act of 1955.[40][41][42] The Citizenship Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord was signed, wherein the Indian government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi agreed to identify foreign citizens, remove them from the electoral roles, and expel them from the country.[43][44][45][46]\n\nThe Citizenship Act was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. In December 2003, the National Democratic Alliance government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 with far-reaching revisions of the Citizenship Act. It added the notion of \"illegal immigrants\" to the Act, making them ineligible to apply for citizenship (by registration or naturalisation), and declaring their children also as illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants were defined as citizens of other countries who entered India without valid travel documents, or who remained in the country beyond the period permitted by their travel documents. They can be deported or jailed.[49]\n\nThe 2003 amendment also mandated the Government of India to create and maintain a National Register of Citizens. The bill was supported by the Indian National Congress, as well as the Left parties, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)).[50][51][f] During the parliamentary debate on the amendment, the leader of opposition, Manmohan Singh, stated that refugees belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and other countries had faced persecution, and requested that the governments approach to granting them citizenship be made more liberal.[53][54][55] According to M.K. Venu, the formulation of the 2003 amendment discussed by Advani and Singh was based on the idea that Muslim groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan that had experienced persecution also needed to be treated with compassion.[55]\n\nImmigrants and refugees\n\nA very large number of illegal immigrants, the largest numbers of whom are from Bangladesh, live in India. The Task Force on Border Management quoted the figure of 15 million illegal migrants in 2001. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government stated in Parliament that there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants in India.[56] The reasons for the scale of migration include a porous border, historical migration patterns, economic reasons, and cultural and linguistic ties. Many illegal migrants from Bangladesh had eventually received the right to vote. According to Niraja Jayal, this enfranchisement was widely described as an attempt to win elections using the votes of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh.[43][58] An unknown number of Pakistani Hindu refugees live in India. An estimated 5,000 refugees arrive per year, citing religious persecution and forced conversion.[59][60][61] A much larger number of refugees, estimated at 5–13 million, have arrived from Bangladesh over the decades due to a variety of complex factors.[62][63]\n\nIndia is not a signatory to either the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol.[65] It does not have a national policy on refugees. All refugees are classed as \"illegal migrants\". While India has been willing to host refugees, its traditional position formulated by Jawaharlal Nehru is that such refugees must return to their home countries after the situation returns to normal.[66][67] According to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, India hosts refugees in excess of 456,000,[68] with about 200,000 from \"non-neighbouring\" countries hosted via the UNHCR.[66][69][g] According to Shuvro Sarker, since the 1950s and particularly since the 1990s, the Indian governments under various political parties have studied and drafted laws for the naturalisation of refugees and asylum seekers. These drafts have struggled with issues relating to a mass influx of refugees, urban planning, cost of basic services, the obligations to protected tribes, the impact on pre-existing regional poverty levels within India.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party activities\n\nThe \"detection, deletion and deportation\" of illegal migrants has been on the agenda of the BJP since 1996. In the 2016 assembly elections for the border state of Assam, the BJP leaders campaigned in the state promising voters that they would rid Assam of the Bangladeshis. Simultaneously, they also promised to protect Hindus who had fled religious persecution in Bangladesh. According to commentators, in the context of an effort to identify and deport illegal immigrants, the proposal to grant citizenship took a new meaning. Illegal migrants could be granted citizenship if they were non-Muslim, on the grounds that they were refugees; Muslims alone would be deported.[35]\n\nIn its manifesto for the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP promised to provide a \"natural home\" for persecuted Hindu refugees.[74] The year before the 2016 elections in Assam, the government legalised refugees belonging to religious minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh, granting them long-term visas. Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals belonging to \"minority communities\" were exempted from the requirements of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946.[75] Specifically mentioned were \"Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists,\" who had been \"compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\". Eligibility for the exemption was made contingent on a migrant having arrived in India by 31 December 2014.[76]\n\nThe BJP government introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] The bill stalled in parliament following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India. Opponents of the bill in Assam and the northeastern states of India stated that any migration from Bangladesh \"irrespective of religion\" would cause \"loss of political rights and culture of the indigenous people\".[78][79] According to Niraja Jayal, while the BJP had promised to grant Indian citizenship to all Hindu migrants from Bangladesh in its election campaigns during the 2010s, the draft Amendment bill angered many in Assam, including its own political allies because they view the amendment as a violation of the Assam Accord.[80] That accord promised to identify and deport all illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered the state after 1971, \"regardless of their religious identity\".[80] In 2018, as the draft of this Amendment was being discussed, numerous Assamese organisations petitioned and agitated against it. They fear that the Amendment will encourage more migration and diminish employment opportunities to the native residents in the state.[80]\n\nIn parallel to the drafting of an amendment to the 1955 Citizenship Act, the BJP government completed an effort to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam. The process for creating the NRC had been put in place by the Citizenship rules enacted in 2003, and had been implemented in Assam under Supreme Court supervision as a result of a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. This was mandated under prior peace agreements in northeast, and the Assam Accord in particular.[82][83] The updated register was made public in August 2019; approximately 1.9 million residents were not on the list, and were in danger of losing their citizenship.[84] Many of those affected were Bengali Hindus, who constitute a major voter base for the BJP; according to commentators, the BJP withdrew its support for the Assam NRC towards its end for this reason.[85][86][h] On 19 November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah, declared in the Rajya Sabha (the Upper House of the Indian parliament) that the National Register of Citizens would be implemented throughout the country.[89]\n\nLegislative history\n\nThe BJP government first introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] Although this bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian parliament, it stalled in the Rajya Sabha, following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India.[78][79]\n\nThe BJP reiterated its commitment to amend the citizenship act in its 2019 election campaign. It stated that religious minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs are persecuted in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries, and promised to fast track a path to citizenship for non-Muslim refugees.[90][91] After the elections, the BJP government drafted a bill that addressed the concerns of its northeastern states. It excluded Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, except for non-tribal cities exempted under pre-existing regulations. It also excluded tribal areas of Assam.[92] The Indian government, while proposing an Amendment, said, that its bill aims to grant quicker access to citizenship to those who have fled religious persecution in neighbouring countries and have taken refuge in India.[21][93][5]\n\nThe Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint parliamentary committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019 to Parliament. The Bill was taken into consideration and passed by Lok Sabha on 8 January 2019. It was pending for consideration and passing by the Rajya Sabha. Consequent to dissolution of 16th Lok Sabha, this Bill has lapsed.[94]\n\nAfter the formation of 17th Lok Sabha, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament.[78][95] The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019,[96] with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.[97][98][99]\n\nThe bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.[100][101] Those voted in favour included Janata Dal (United), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR Congress Party.[100][101]\n\nAfter receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act.[102] The act came into force on 10 January 2020.[1][103] The implementation of the CAB began on 20 December 2019, when Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya gave citizenship certificates to seven refugees from Pakistan.[104]\n\nThe Amendments\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, by inserting the following provisos in section 2, sub-section (1), after clause (b):[103]\n\nProvided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;[103]\n\nA new section 6B was inserted (in the section concerning naturalisation), with four clauses, the first of which stated:\n\n(1) The Central Government or an authority specified by it in this behalf may, subject to such conditions, restrictions and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, grant a certificate of registration or certificate of naturalisation to a person referred to in the proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2.[103]\n\nThe \"exempted\" classes of persons were previously defined in the Foreigners (Amendment) Order, 2015 (issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946):[76]\n\n3A. Exemption of certain class of foreigners. – (1) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before the 31st December, 2014 (a) without valid documents including passport or other travel documents and who have been exempted under rule 4 from the provisions of rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 [...]; or (b) with valid documents including passport or other travel document and the validity of any of such documents has expired, are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be [...].[76]\n\nThe Rules had been further amended in 2016 by adding Afghanistan to the list of countries.[105]\n\nExemptions were granted to northeastern regions of India in the clause (4) of section 6B:\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and the area covered under \"The Inner Line\" notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873.'.[103]\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Act has amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 to give eligibility for Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and who entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act does not mention Muslims.[106][107] According to Intelligence Bureau records, the immediate beneficiaries of the Amended Act will be 31,313 people, which include 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[16][108]\n\nUnder the act, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have lived in India during the last 12 months, and for 11 of the previous 14 years. The bill relaxes this 11-year requirement to 5 years for persons belonging to the same six religions and three countries. The bill exempts the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura from its applicability. It also exempts the areas regulated through the Inner Line Permit, which include Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.[109][110][111] The inclusion of Manipur in Inner Line Permit was also announced on 9 December 2019.[92]\n\nThe bill includes new provisions for cancellation of the registration of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) if there are any violations of the provisions of this act or provisions of any other law of India. It also adds the opportunity for the OCI holder to be heard before the cancellation.[103][78]\n\nExclusion of persecuted Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\n\nMuslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not offered eligibility for citizenship under the new Act.[5][6][112] Critics have questioned the exclusion. The amendment limits itself to the Muslim-majority neighbours of India and takes no cognisance of the persecuted Muslims of those countries.[70] According to The Economist, if the Indian government was concerned about religious persecution, it should have included Ahmadiyyas – a Muslim sect who have been \"viciously hounded in Pakistan as heretics\", and the Hazaras – another Muslim sect who have been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They should be treated as minorities.[22] India's minister of minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi defended the exclusion of the Ahmadiyyas by saying that India does not consider them as non-Muslims.[113] A landmark 1970 judgement from the Kerala High Court deemed Ahmadiyyas to be Muslims by the Indian law.[114] Naqvi added that India has provided refuge to different persecuted sects at different times, and Ahmaddiyas will not be forgotten.[113]\n\nPakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries that have modified their constitutions in recent decades to declare Islam their official state religion. Therefore, according to the Indian government, Muslims in these Islamic countries are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\". The government says that Muslims cannot be \"treated as persecuted minorities\" in these Muslim-majority countries.[21][11] The BBC says that while these countries have provisions in their constitution guaranteeing non-Muslims rights, including the freedom to practice their religion, in practice non-Muslim populations have experienced discrimination and persecution.[21]\n\nExclusion of other persecuted communities\n\nThe Act does not include migrants from non-Muslim countries fleeing persecution to India, Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka, and Buddhist refugees from Tibet, China.\n\nThe Act does not mention Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamils were allowed to settle as refugees in Tamil Nadu in 1980s and 1990s due to systemic violence from the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka. They include 29,500 \"hill country Tamils\" (Malaiha).[67][115]\n\nThe Act does not provide relief to Tibetan Buddhist refugees,[18] who came to India in the 1950s and 1960s. Their status has been of refugees over the decades. According to a 1992 UNHCR report, the then Indian government stated that they remain refugees and do not have the right to acquire Indian nationality.[116]\n\nThe Act does not address Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar. The Indian government has been deporting Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[23][117]\n\nRelationship to NRC\n\nThe National Register of Citizens is a registry of all legal citizens, whose construction and maintenance was mandated by the 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act. As of January 2020, it has only been implemented for the state of Assam, but the BJP has promised its implementation for the whole of India in its 2019 election manifesto.[118] The NRC documents all the legal citizens so that the people who are left out can be recognized as illegal immigrants (often called \"foreigners\"). The experience with Assam NRC shows that many people were declared \"foreigners\" because their documents were deemed insufficient.[119]\n\nIn this context, there are concerns that the present amendment of the Citizenship Act provides a \"shield\" to the non-Muslims, who can claim that they were migrants who fled persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the Muslims do not have such a benefit.[120][121][122][123] Such a claim may be possible only for people in the border states who have some ethnic resemblance to the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, but not to the people of interior states.[19][124] Muslim leaders have interpreted the CAA–NRC package in precisely these terms, viz., that the Muslims in the country would be targeted (by considering documents as insufficient) as potential foreigners, leaving out all non-Muslims.[19]\n\nIn an interview to India Today, Home Minister Amit Shah offered reassurance that no Indian citizen needs to worry. \"We will make special provisions to ensure that no Indian citizen from minority communities is victimised in the NRC process.\" But the Indian Express said that the purpose of the NRC is precisely to identify the Indian citizens. So these references to \"Indian citizens\" remain unexplained.[19]\n\nReception\n\nLocals protest against the CAB in New Delhi on 14 December 2019\n\nLocals and Jamia Millia Islamia students protest against CAA/NRC in New Delhi on 15 December 2019\n\nProtests\n\nThe passage of the Act triggered different types of protests and criticisms. Violent protests erupted in Assam, where the protesters maintained that the new provisions of this Act are against prior agreements such as the Assam Accord,[26][27] and that they would cause a \"loss of political rights and culture\". The India-Japan summit in Guwahati, which was supposed to be attended by Shinzō Abe was cancelled.[125][126] The UK, USA, France, Israel and Canada issued travel warnings for people visiting India's north-east region, telling their citizens to \"exercise caution\".[127][128][129]\n\nIn other parts of India, political and student activists protested that the law \"marginalizes Muslims, is prejudicial against Muslims\" and sought that Muslim migrants and refugees should also be granted Indian citizenship per its secular foundations.[28] The protesters demanded that the law should grant Indian citizenship to Muslim immigrants and refugees too.[29]\n\nProtests against the bill were held in several metropolitan cities across India, including Kolkata,[127] Delhi,[130][131] Mumbai,[100] Bengaluru,[132] Hyderabad,[133] and Jaipur.[130] Rallies were also held in various Indian states of West Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Bihar, Maharastra, Kerala and Karnataka.[127] 27 people were killed by police firing guns in the whole of India.[134][135]\n\nVarious cities around the world, including New York, Washington D. C.,[136] Paris, Berlin,[137] Geneva, Barcelona, San Francisco, Tokyo, Helsinki,[138] and Amsterdam, witnessed protests against the Act and the police brutality faced by Indian protesters.[139][140]\n\nStudents from various universities like Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, Nadwa College, Jawaharlal Nehru University, IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras, Jadavpur University, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, IISc, Pondicherry University, and IIM Ahmedabad also held protest. More than 25 student associations from all over India joined protest. On 15 December, police forcefully entered the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia university, where protests were being held, and detained the students. Police used batons and tear gas on the students. More than a hundred students were injured and an equal number were detained. The police action was widely criticized, and resulted in protests across the country.[141][142][143]\n\nMuslims all over India came out to protest the CAA–NRC package with a renewed assertion of their identity as Indians.[144] Muslim women started protest at Shaheen Bagh on 15 December 2019 start as an ongoing 24/7 sit-in peaceful protest.[145][146][147] The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have blocked a major highway[i] in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for more than 51 days now as of 5 February 2020.[148] On 24 February, violent clashes occurred during the North East Delhi riots in which seven people where killed and more than a hundred injured.[149] The death toll rose to 42 in 36 hours with 250 people getting injured.[150]\n\nIndian government response\n\nOn 16 December, after the protests entered the fifth day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm in a series of tweets saying \"No Indian has anything to worry regarding this act. This act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India\".[151][152] As CAA protests raised concerns on combined effects of CAA with NRC, the government has sought to downplay its narrative on NRC, with both the PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah stating that there has been no talk on pan-Indian NRC in their government for now, and neither the cabinet nor the legal department has discussed it.[153][19]\n\nConsidering Violence and damage to public properties during demonstration, on 19 December, police banned protests in several parts of India with the imposition of section 144 which prohibits the gathering of more than 4 individuals in a public space as being unlawful, namely, parts of the capital Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka, including Bangalore. Police in Chennai denied permission for marches, rallies or any other demonstration.[154][155] Internet services were shutdown in several parts of Delhi. As a result of defining the ban, thousands of protesters were detained, including several opposition leaders and activists such as Ramachandra Guha, Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sandeep Dikshit, Tehseen Poonawalla and D Raja.[156][157][158]\n\nRallies in support\n\nStudent groups such as those from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – a student wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, held rallies in support of the amended Citizenship Act.[159][160] Rallies in support of the Amendment Act were led by BJP leaders in West Bengal, who alleged that the state government blocked them. They also accused the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party members of misinforming the state's residents about the new law.[161] Similarly, some 15,000 people joined a BJP-organised rally in support of the Act in Rajasthan.[162] On 20 December 2019, scores of people held demonstrations in Central Park, Connaught Place, New Delhi in support of the Act.[163][164] Hundreds of people gathered in Pune, forming a human chain, in support of CAA, on 22 December.[165][166] ABVP members held a rally in support of CAA and NRC in Kerala.[167] Hundreds of citizens were out on the streets in support of the citizenship law in Bangalore.[168] Members of the Social Democratic Party of India, linked to the Islamist militant organization Popular Front of India, were paid Rs.10000 to attack leaders supporting CAA in Bengaluru according to the Police[169]\n\nRefugees\n\nHindu refugee families in Assam, living since the 1960s in a refugee camp and who had been denied Indian citizenship so far, said that the Amendment had \"kindled hope\" at first. They added that the recent protests against the Act and demands for its cancellation have made them fearful of the future.[170] In New Delhi, about 600 refugees from Pakistan living in a camp consisting of tiny shanties celebrated the new law.[171] A delegation of Sikh refugees who had arrived from Afghanistan three decades ago thanked the Indian government for amending the citizenship law. They stated the Amended law would allow them to finally gain Indian citizenship and \"join the mainstream\".[172]\n\nSome Rohingya Muslim refugees in India were not optimistic about the Amendment and feared they would be deported.[173][174] Other Rohingya refugees expressed gratitude at having been allowed to stay in India, but did not make any comments specific to the Act lest they provoke a backlash. They said that local police had asked them not to protest against the Act.[175]\n\nMore than 200 families have arrived in the Indian state of Punjab with all their belongings after the law was enacted.[176]\n\nPolitical and legal challenge\n\nThe bill was opposed by the Indian National Congress, who said it would create communal tensions and polarise India.[177] The Chief Ministers of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala and Rajasthan and union territory of Puducherry – all led by non-BJP governments – said they will not implement the law.[178][179][127] According to the Union Home Ministry, states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \"the new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it\".[33] Modi stated on 21 December that the NRC had only been implemented in Assam to follow a directive from the Supreme Court of India, and that there had been no decision taken to implement it nation-wide.[180]\n\nThe Indian Union Muslim League petitioned the Supreme Court of India to declare the bill illegal.[181][182] The royal family of Tripura also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the bill.[183] The first hearing by the Supreme Court of India on 60 petitions challenging the Act was on 18 December 2019. During the first hearing, the court declined to stay implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.[181] On 22 January 2020, around 143 petitions, including several petitions filed after 18 December 2019 were heard. Court again declined the request for stay. Bench, presided over by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde indicated that the matter may be referred to a larger bench. a as the next date of hearing.[184][185] The next hearing was scheduled on 21 April 2020.[186]\n\nThe foreign intelligence agency of India, R&AW, had expressed concern while deposing in front of the joint parliamentary committee, and had stated that the bill could be used by agents of the foreign intelligence agencies to infiltrate legally into India.[187] Former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon called the incident a self inflicted goal that has isolated India from the International community.[188]\n\nHarish Salve, former Solicitor General of India, said that the bill does not violate Article 14, Article 25 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.[189] He points out that Article 15 and Article 21 apply only to the entities which reside in India, not to those which want to enter India. Salve says that the bill doesn't violate secularism and describes it as a 'narrowly-tailored' provision that is designed to address a specific issue.[190]\n\nA group of prominent individuals and organisations from around 12 countries representing minorities of Bangladesh released a joint statement in which they described the Act as “humanitarian” provision through which India has \"partially fulfilled\" its obligations towards the minorities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.[191] The National Sikh Front – a group representing the Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir, stated that it supports the Act because it will help the Sikh refugees in India who left Afghanistan.[192]\n\nA petition opposing the bill was signed by more 1,000 Indian scientists and scholars.[193] The petition stated that \"The use of religion as a criterion for citizenship in the proposed bill\" was \"inconsistent with the basic structure of the Constitution\".[193] A similar number of Indian academicians and intellectuals released a statement in support of the legislation.[194] The petition stated that the act \"fulfills the long-standing demand of providing refuge to persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\".[195]\n\nInternational reactions\n\nThis act was denounced by both the Hindu and Sikh communities of Pakistan. In particular, it was rejected by the Pakistan Hindu Council, a representative body of Hindus in the country. Many lawmakers were vocal in voicing their protest over this legislation. These included Lal Chand Malhi, member of the national assembly from Pakistan's ruling party Tehreek-e-Insaf, and Sachanand Lakhwani, member of the provincial assembly of Sindh.[210]\n\nSupranational\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\n^ Sharma (2019) , p. 523: \"First, citizenship status biased towards religious identity is by no means a new idea....

On December 9, 2019, the CAB Bill was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha's Winter Session. President Ram Nath Kovind signed it on December 12. What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to fast-track citizenship for persecuted minority groups in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The six minority groups that have been specifically identified are Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis. The Bill aims to change the definition of illegal migrants. However, the Act doesn’t have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmedis who also face persecution in Pakistan. The beneficiaries of Citizenship Amendment Bill can reside in any state of the country and the burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Presently, the Constitution of India provides for citizenship by naturalisation – for people who have lived in India for the past 12 months and for 11 of the past 14 years. It also provides for people whose parents or grandparents were born in India to become Indian citizens. Who are illegal immigrants from India perspective? As per the Citizenship Act, 1955, an illegal immigrant is one who enters India with fake or forged documents and/or does not have a valid passport. A person who stays beyond the visa permit is also referred to as an illegal immigrant. When did the issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill come up? Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was seeking to topple the Congress-led UPA government, promised to grant citizenship to Hindus persecuted in the neighbouring countries. In the party's election manifesto, the BJP promised to give shelter to the Hindus and welcome the refugees. Which parties are against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and why? BJP's coalition partner Assam Gana Parishad has threatened to cut ties with the party if the Bill is passed. NGOs like Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti and students' organisation All Assam Students’ Union also have come forward in opposing the Bill. All Opposition parties, including the Congress and All India United Democratic Front, have opposed the idea of granting citizenship to an individual on the basis of religion. It is also argued that the Bill if made into an Act, will nullify the updated National Registration of Citizenship (NRC). Parties and activists opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 are of the view that it works against the cultural and linguistic identity of the indigenous people. Mizoram and other northeastern states, which have a diverse indigenous community, have urged the government not to table the new citizenship bill, saying it will open a \"floodgate” of illegal immigrants in the state. In January 2019, days after Union home minister Amit Shah announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill would be brought in parliament again, protests were held in Manipur, Nagaland and Meghalaya. The Nagaland and North East Forum of Indigenous People (NEFIP) claimed that it would seek the United Nations’ intervention if the Centre implements the Bill. Northeast protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Bill has divided India into protests and jubilations. While Hindu refugee communities across India are celebrating the government's move, a majority of Northeast remains on edge. Guwahati was the epicentre of anti-CAB protests. People in the north-eastern states fear that the Bill would change the demography of the states if it is passed as people of different cultures and languages will get citizenship of the country. Currently, the northeast is witnessing protests against Bangladeshi immigrants. Exemptions under Citizenship Bill 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill exempts certain areas in the North-East from this provision. It would not apply to tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura. This effectively means that Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram along with almost whole of Meghalaya and parts of Assam and Tripura would stay out of the purview of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Amendments for OCI cardholders According to the Citizenship Bill, a foreigner may register as an Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) if they are of Indian origin or their spouse is of Indian origin. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill entitles the OCI cardholders to benefits such as the right to travel to India, and to work and study in the country. What is the current status of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019? The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was referred to a joint select committee in 2016, after being discussed extensively in the Lok Sabha. Members of the parliamentary committee visited several parts of the northeastern states and discussed the Bill with various organisation. On January 8, 2019 the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha. However, before it could be tabled in the Rajya Sabha, the Bill lapsed on June 3, 2019, as the tenure of the Lok Sabha ended. The Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019 passed the Bill. However, the Opposition, which terms it 'unconstitutional', is likely to knock the Supreme Court of India's door to protest against the Bill. Meanwhile, protests in the north east, particularly in Assam continue.\n\nCitizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019\n\n\"Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;\".\n\n[Gazette notification dated December 12, 2019]An Act further to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 .

The protests were seen mostly in India’s northeast regions, particularly in Assam and Tripura, home to more than 230 different Indigenous Peoples. India’s northeast seven states share borders with Bangladesh, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and China.\n\n\n\nThrough the new Citizenship Amendment Bill, Indian Citizenship is granted to illegal migrants from neighboring countries—Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, which some Indigenous Peoples fear that the law would make them a minority in their homelands. According to them, with ill intention, the government of India through CAB wants to wipe out their histories, cultures, languages, and identities. Therefore, millions of people took to the streets against the Bill.\n\n\n\nProtesters are demanding the recall of the amended Citizenship Amendment Bill. Many torched vehicles, disrupted rail, road, and air services in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh. There were frequent clashes between police and protesters, injuries including killings. To quell tension, Indian authorities shut down mobile and internet connections and called on army personnel to restore order and imposed a curfew.\n\n\n\n“The government of India introduced the Bill without any proper consultations with concerned representatives and without a study of the impact,” said Ken Timung Arleng, young Indigenous rights activist at Diphu Assam in a conversation with Cultural Survival. “The Citizenship Amendment Bill is likely to curtail the continuity of languages, cultures including economic well-being of the Indigenous Peoples of Assam and the northeast.”\n\n\n\n“If the government of India grants citizenship to foreign immigrants, irrespective of religion, race, or culture, it will cause effects not only on the political rights, but also the cultural and land rights of the majority of Indigenous populations in Assam as the law motivates more migration from foreign countries,” says, D. S. Lekhthe, a lawyer from Assam. “Assamese view that the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Bill will adversely impact the people of Assam and the northeast most.”\n\n\n\nThe new law allows migrants who arrived in India before 2014 to become citizens. In Assam, the biggest state in the northeast, ongoing tensions have been going on for years between Assamese speakers and Bengali-speaking migrants who have crossed a porous border with Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nFollowing the massive protests and flow of news that Citizenship Amendment Bill discriminates against Muslims, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) held a press briefing on India outlining their concerns about the new law, stating that it is “fundamentally discriminatory in nature” and that “OHCHR hopes the Supreme Court of India will consider carefully the compatibility of the law with India’s international human Rights obligations.”\n\n\n\nAgitators continue their protest across northeast, demanding the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord, with which the newly passed Bill conflicts. The 1985 Accord states foreigners who entered Assam before March 25, 1971 were to be given citizenship and rest had to be expelled. The amended Bill shifts the cut-off date to December 2014 from December 1951 as the date of detection and deportation and also creates a National Register of Citizens (NRC). In order to conduct a census in 2021, the government of India is planning to collect data for the National Population Register (NPR) in 2020 to create a NRC afterward to identify illegal immigrants across the country. In 1951, a National Register of Citizens in Assam was created to determine who was born in the state before March 24, 1971. The final version of the list unveiled recently strips approximately 1.9 million people in Assam (which borders Bangladesh) of citizenship of those who declared themselves as foreigners. This is also likely impact Bangladesh, as there maybe potential influx of immigrants from India. Bangladesh is already grappling with over 900,000 Rohigya refugees from Myanmar, who are unlikely to be repatriated.\n\n\n\nFollowing the massive protests which took place for six years beginning in 1979, led by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) based on the issues that foreigners—mainly Bangladeshis—were included on voter lists, in 1985, the government of India agreed to the Assam Accord comprising of 15 clauses. Clause 5 of the Accord deals with the issue of foreigners, their detection, the deletion of their names from the voter lists, and their deportation through practical means. The clause states, “all persons who came to Assam prior to 1 January 1966, including those amongst them whose name appeared on the electoral rolls used in 1967 elections, shall be regularized,” meaning illegal immigrants who entered Assam before December 31, 1965 were to be granted citizenship with voting rights immediately.\n\n\n\nClause 5 also further states, “foreigners who came to Assam after 1 January 1966 and up to 24 March 1971 shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Act, 1946 and the Foreigners (Tribunals) order 1964.” This meant immigrants who came to Assam between 1966 and March 24, 1971 were to be disqualified and had to get registered themselves as “foreigners” in accordance with the Registration of Foreign Act 1939.\n\n\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Bill shifts the cut-off date for granting citizenship from March 24, 1971 to December 31, 2014. The protestors argue that this move is going back on the government’s promise made to protect the cultural identities of Assamese and the northeast region. Another provision challenged during the protests is clause 6 of the Accord, which states, “the constitutional, legislative and administrative steps will be taken by the Center to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.”\n\n\n\n“I want to assure my brothers and sisters of Assam that they have nothing to worry after the passing of CAB”, said Narrendra Modi, Prime Minister of India on Twit trying to calm the fury in the northeast. “I want to assure them—no one takes away your rights, unique identity and beautiful culture. It will continue to flourish and grow.\"\n\n\n\nActivists view that there were flaws in the procedural laws and non-implementation of the obligations set forth in the Accord. Sanaton Laishram, a human rights activist from Manipur says, “There is a contradiction between safeguarding culture, identity, including political rights of iIndigenous Peoples of the northeast and CAB, including with NRC. Thus there is a clear need to conduct a study on the effect of the law beforehand and to hold dialogue meaningfully across concerned populations who fear that their culture and identity will be submerged.”\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has slated to hear the dozens of petitions filed to review Citizenship Amendment Bill on January 22, 2020.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Rita Willaert.","title":"Citizenship Amendment Bill Negatively Impacts Indigenous Peoples of Northeast India","author":[],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/citizenship-amendment-bill-negatively-impacts-indigenous-peoples-northeast-india","image":"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2246719831_ac95694abb_c.jpg?itok=e53_RNkw"}

The Act seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. They will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. So far 12 years of residence has been the standard eligibility requirement for naturalisation.At the first hearing on petitions challenging the CAA, the Supreme Court declined to stay the contentious law but asked the Centre to file its reply against the petitions that say it violates the Constitution. The petitioners say the Bill discriminates against Muslims and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution. Here's a primer.The legislation applies to those who were “forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion”. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration. The cut-off date for citizenship is December 31, 2014 which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date. Indian citizenship, under present law, is given either to those born in India or if they have resided in the country for a minimum of 11 years. The Bill also proposes to incorporate a sub-section (d) to Section 7, providing for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force.Centre says these minority groups have come escaping persecution in Muslim-majority nations. However, the logic is not consistent – the bill does not protect all religious minorities, nor does it apply to all neighbours. The Ahmedia Muslim sect and even Shias face discrimination in Pakistan. Rohingya Muslims and Hindus face persecution in neighbouring Burma, and Hindu and Christian Tamils in neighbouring Sri Lanka. The government responds that Muslims can seek refuge in Islamic nations, but has not answered the other questions. Amit Shah says that the Bill would not have been necessary if the Congress did not agree to Partition on the basis of religion. However, India was not created on the basis of religion, Pakistan was. Only the Muslim League and the Hindu Right advocated the two nation theory of Hindu and Muslim nations, which led to Partition. All the founders of India were committed to a secular state, where all citizens irrespective of religion enjoyed full membership. Either way, this logic for the CAB also collapses because Afghanistan was not part of pre-Partition India.CAB won't apply to areas under the sixth schedule of the Constitution – which deals with autonomous tribal-dominated regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The bill will also not apply to states that have the inner-line permit regime (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram).Among the states in the Northeast, the outrage against CAG has been the most intense in Assam. While a chunk of these states have been exempted from the legislation, CAB overs a large part of Assam. The protests stem from the fear that illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, if regularised under CAB, will threaten cultural and linguistic identities of the state.The National Register of Citizens or NRC that we saw in Assam targeted illegal immigrants. A person had to prove that either they, or their ancestors were in Assam on or before March 24, 1971. NRC, which may be extended to the rest of the country, is not based on religion unlike CAB.The CAB ringfences Muslim identity by declaring India a welcome refuge to all other religious communities. It seeks to legally establish Muslims as second-class citizens of India by providing preferential treatment to other groups. This violates the Constitution’s Article 14, the fundamental right to equality to all persons. This basic structure of the Constitution cannot be reshaped by any Parliament. And yet, the government maintains that it does not discriminate or violate the right to equality.The President gave his assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on December 12, a day after it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. However, the home ministry has yet to notify the rules to operationalise the law. The notification of rules may now have to wait as a decision in this regard will be taken after seeking experts’ advice since the matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court.The petitions against the Act are listed for hearing on January 22. In case experts feel that the rules can be challenged on legal grounds, the government will wait till January 22. Since the apex court did not clamp a stay on CAA, the home ministry could notify rules about who all can apply for citizenship, notify the authority and state minimum requirements and cut-off date.","title":"What is CAA, Citizenship Amendment Act?

Meanwhile, the government has maintained that the bill is not Assam-centric, but applicable to the whole country. It is not against the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is being updated to protect indigenous communities from illegal immigrants. The government has also clarified that the bill does not dilute the sanctity of the Assam Accord as far as the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, stipulated for detection/deportation of illegal immigrants is concerned.\n\nThe bill also drew flak from opposition parties for excluding Muslims from the religious communities that it seeks to grant Indian citizenship to on grounds of religious persecution.

Enacted in 1955, this act also enables people who were once citizens of India but are now citizens of another country, among others, to apply for an Overseas Citizen of India Card.\n\nCitizenship in India can be attained through five methods:\n\n• by birth in India,\n\n• by descent,\n\n• through registration,\n\n• by naturalisation (extended residence in India), and\n\n• incorporation of a foreign territory into India\n\nHow many times has the law been amended\n\nThe Citizenship Act, 1955 has been amended five times — 1986, 1992, 2003, 2005, 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe 1986 amendment\n\nThe 1986 amendment stipulates that in order to be a citizen of India, one of the parents had to be an Indian citizen during the time of birth.\n\nThe 1992 amendment\n\nThe 1992 amendment states a person born outside India shall be a citizen of India by descent, on or after January 26, 1950, but before December 10, 1992, if his father is a citizen of India at the time of his birth.\n\nThe 2003 amendment\n\nThe 2003 amendment introduced the notion of “illegal immigrants” and also mandated the Government of India to conduct a National Register of Citizens (NRC).\n\nEnacted under the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the amendment inserted Section 14A that provided for conducting headcount of Indian citizens and preparation of the NRC.\n\nThe 2005 amendment\n\nTo accommodate the growing overseas Indian population, at the turn of the millennium, the parliament introduced the concepts of Person of Indian Origin (PIO) and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI). They were granted certain limited citizenship rights through an amendment made in 2005.\n\nFor example: OCI card holders were granted multiple entries, multi-purpose lifelong visa to visit India, exempted from registration with Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) for any length of stay in India and could participate in financial, economic and educational fields.\n\nWhereas, PIO cardholders were exempted from reporting to the police during their period of stay in India. They were also entitled to visa-free entry into India during the validity of the card i.e. 15 years, provided they carried valid national passports.\n\nThe 2015 amendment\n\nThe 2015 amendment introduced the concept of an ‘Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder’ (an “OCC”) that essentially replaced and merged OCIs and PIOs. The merging of the two schemes provided PIO cardholders the benefits extended to OCIs, such as visa-free travel to India, rights of residency and participation in business and educational activities in the country.\n\nThe 2019 amendment\n\nThe latest amendment to the Citizenship Act will make it easier for non-Muslims to become citizens of India. Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who escaped religious persecution and arrived in India before December 31, 2014, will be eligible for Indian citizenship. Muslims, however, have been left out.\n\nThe duration of residence in India for those seeking citizenship has also been reduced. Earlier, it was compulsory for an individual to have stayed in India for at least 11 years to become a citizen naturally. It has been reduced to six years.\n\nThe controversy around the 2019 amendment\n\nThe controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill sailed through both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha in December. The President’s ascent triggered massive protests across the country in which many lives were lost.\n\nThe act has been widely criticised as being “anti–Muslim” as it excludes Muslims from neighbouring countries.\n\nThe law violates Article 14 of the Constitution as it makes illegal migrants eligible for citizenship on the basis of religion. Article 14 guarantees equality to all persons, citizens and foreigners. It only allows laws to distinguish between people if the rationale for doing so serves a reasonable purpose.\n\nOpposition and reactions\n\nOpposition parties, human rights activists, student organisations have taken to the streets saying the law discriminates against Muslims and is a violation of the Constitution\n\nCongress President Sonia Gandhi has said that the law will “shred the soul of India”.\n\nWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee carried out a 10-day protest march in Kolkata against CAA and NRC. She has called the law “discriminatory” and demanded equal protection be given to all irrespective of their religion.\n\nEarlier this week, Kerala became the first state to pass a resolution against the controversial law.\n\nDMK chief and leader of opposition in Tamil Nadu state assembly, MK Stalin also took out a massive rally in Chennai.\n\nUN secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his concerns about the violence and the “alleged use of excessive force” in the protests against the law.\n\nPetitions\n\nOver 60 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the controversial law. Among those who filed the petitions are senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, the Indian Union Muslim League, Mahua Moitra, Asaduddin Owaisi, Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam and Asom Gana Parishad, an ally of the ruling BJP in Assam.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said it will hear all the petitions against the citizenship law on 22 January, 2020.\n\nWhy is Assam upset\n\nHistorically, Assam has been a hotbed of protests. Back in 1970s, students across the state led agitations and protests for five years and successfully pressurized the Union government into providing constitutional and legislative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people.\n\nThe five-year agitation came to an end on 15th August 1985 when a Memorandum of Understanding, The Assam Accord, was signed between the Rajiv Gandhi’s Congress government and the All Assam Student’s Union, led by Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. One of the major agreements of the Assam Accord was to deport immigrants entering Assam after 1971.\n\nThe recently amended citizenship law annuls the 1985 Assam Accord. For recognition as citizens, clause 5 of the Assam Accord sets March 24, 1971 as the cutoff, but now that date has been brought forward to December 31, 2014.","title":"All you need to know about the Citizenship Act, 1955","author":["India Legal","Please Enter Your Name Here"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1578037200000"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-citizenship-act-1955","image":"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2019/12/21144833/Lead-6.jpg"}

In a nutshell, this legal move, usually referred to as the CAA for short, offers citizenship for persons who came to India from one of the following three neighboring countries while fleeing persecution: Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, citizenship can be granted provided that they had arrived by December 31, 2014, and that they are of any other religious community in those countries apart from the Muslim one. This last caveat caused large-scale protests in the country and condemnation outside its borders. As half a year has passed since the CAA was voted through, it is now time for a reckoning: did the law affect New Delhi’s international position?\n\nIn my commentary published for the Indian think-tank, Observer Research Foundation, I argued that another contentious issue – India’s ruling party’s recent policies on Kashmir – had hurt New Delhi’s international image, but not its real position in the world. The same conclusion, I believe, generally stands true for the CAA controversy as well.\n\nHas any nation, bank, or company cancelled any economic deals with New Delhi because of CAA? Not to my knowledge. Have any sanctions been thrown at India? No. Has any country used military force, even by proxy, in reaction to New Delhi’s passing of the controversial law? Again, the answer is no, as Pakistan-connected entities had been active in India long before December 2019.\n\nIslamabad unsurprisingly criticized the Indian government’s move in strong words. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan suggested that the CAA’s passing may even lead to a conflict between the two countries. Yet, given that the relations between the two countries are constantly strained, such saber-rattling rhetoric came neither as surprising nor as a change to the overall international equation.\n\nA useful summary of various critical voices, published for The Diplomat by an Indian expert, Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, shows that the Indian government’s image in the world did indeed take a beating. Yet, most of these acts of condemnation remained in the realm of diplomatic rhetoric or discussions on human rights. These reactions included censure from certain Islamic nations, such as Indonesia and Iran, and an announcement from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) that it was planning to “file an application on the CAA in the Indian Supreme Court.”\n\nThere were also diplomatic spats between India and Bangladesh, particularly after insensitive comments by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. These, as pointed out by Amit Ranjan for the The Diplomat, led to the cancellation and postponement of certain visits and talks, but so far no other major effect is apparent.\n\nAmong the three neighbors, the migrants from which will be affected by CAA, New Delhi has enjoyed friendliest relations with Afghanistan (ever since 2001). Thus, displeasure over the new legal act in this country should be worrying for India. Even ex-president Hamid Karzai, known to be particularly close to India, asked the New Delhi government “to treat all Afghans equally” (as most of the nation’s citizens are Muslims). Still, there is no evidence that the controversy pulled Afghanistan-India relations downward. Given the scale of New Delhi’s past assistance to Afghanistan (a subject I summarized here) and the image India enjoys in that country, it is possible that CAA will not cause large-scale diplomatic conflict with Kabul.\n\nUnited States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells voiced careful concern about CAA just after she came back from the Raisina Dialogue, held in New Delhi in January 2020 (in her briefing before the State Department). This did not stop U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit India nearly a month later, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of April, the United States Commission on International Religious suggested in a new report that the U.S. government should designate India a “country of particular concern” and even impose sanctions on Indian “agencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedom by freezing those individuals’ assets and or barring their entry into the United States.” The CAA was the primary, though not the only, reason given by the commission to justify this view. Yet, this did not mean that its conclusions reflected Washington’s official position. It is improbable that the United States will decide to introduce such sanctions at a time of a fast-growing India-U.S. partnership, especially given that the “agencies and officials” responsible for the CAA would include some of India’s most influential politicians and most significant ministries.\n\nAs for the European Union, various groups of parties introduced their draft resolutions in the European Parliament, all of which criticized the CAA to various degrees. Elements of few resolutions were then condensed into one draft resolution. Further moves signaled that the EU did not want to put its ties with India in peril for the sake of this issue, however. At the end of January, it was decided that the EU Parliament’s vote on the resolution was to be postponed until late March, effectively moving it after the planned EU-India summit (which subsequently was also postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has not taken place till the time of writing). Moreover, as noticed by Geeta Mohan for India Today, the EU’s Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stressed that the proposed resolutions were “only drafts tabled by various political groups,” and not the official position of the European Union as such.\n\nIt must be added, however, that the issue of CAA is connected to another contentious legal decision: the gradual introduction of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India. Since in the previous decades the largest influx of people to India came from Bangladesh, the realization of both CAA and NRC would have to mean that many Bangladeshi nationals will be deported. This issue may thus affect New Delhi’s ties with Dhaka in the future.","title":"Did the Controversial Citizenship Amendment Act Affect India’s International Position?","author":["Krzysztof Iwanek"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/did-the-controversial-citizenship-amendment-act-affect-indias-international-position/","image":"https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2020-01-14-10.jpg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5f27532e953e2d0d883f362b"},"channel":"Google","query":"citizenship amendment act","text":"Text Size: A- A+\n\nNew Delhi: For the past week, protests — some violent, some peaceful — have broken out across the country over the amended citizenship law that was passed by Parliament last week.\n\nThe agitation that began in Assam, other parts of the Northeast and West Bengal soon spread to several university campuses — including Jamia Millia, AMU, Jadavpur University, TISS, IIT-Bombay and IIT-Madras.\n\nOn Thursday, many parts of Delhi saw an internet shutdown as well as massive traffic restrictions and diversions in view of two scheduled protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. At least 19 Metro stations were closed in the national capital.\n\nAs the demonstrations continue in several cities including Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, ThePrint looks at what the issue is and how the new amendment changes the nature of the original Act.\n\nWhat is the original citizenship amendment law and how is citizenship granted in India?\n\nThe nationality law of India is primarily based on citizenship by right of blood (jus sanguinis) and not a citizenship by right of birth within a territory (jus soli). Article 5 to Article 11 of the Indian Constitution governs Indian citizenship and the law in regard to this is the Citizenship Act of 1955.\n\nThe 1955 Act was amended six times — 1986, 1992, 2003, 2005, 2015 and 2019. While the 2003 amendment mandated the government to have a National Register of Citizens, the latest one seeks to ease the citizenship process for the persecuted minorities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian — of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the basic amendment that the 2019 Act brings to 1955 Act?\n\nNon-Muslim immigrants from India’s three Muslim-majority neighbours — Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan — will be granted Indian citizenship, provided they entered India before 31 December 2014.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions. Quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. Your support will define our work and ThePrint’s future. SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe Act does not explicitly state that Muslims are barred, however, the fact that it spells out the religious communities that will benefit from the amendment makes it clear that Muslims have been kept out.\n\nAlso read: Liberal, secular opposition to CAA must not allow room for Islamic and Left radicals\n\nWho will benefit from the amendment?\n\nPeople from the explicitly stated six religions will be granted citizenship if they arrived in India before December 31 2014. Bluntly put, if people from these religious communities hailing from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan apply for citizenship, they will not be deported for not having documents, and will be granted citizenship.\n\nThe 1955 Act required a person applying for citizenship to have resided in India for 11 of the previous 14 years. The 2019 amendment relaxes this requirement from 11 years to five years for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians from the three nations.\n\nWho will be excluded?\n\nThe 2019 amendment Act does not apply to tribal areas of Tripura, Mizoram, Assam and Meghalaya because of being included in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nAlso, areas that fall under the Inner Line Permit notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, will also be outside the Act’s purview. This keeps almost entire Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland out of the ambit of the Act.\n\nNext, according to the 2019 Act, a foreigner may register as an OCI under the 1955 Act if they are of Indian origin (e.g., a former citizen of India or their descendants) or the spouse of a person of Indian origin.\n\nThe new Act also entitles the OCI cardholders to benefits such as the right to travel to India and to work and study in the country. However, the new law permits the cancellation of OCI registration if the person has violated any law notified by the central government.\n\nHow is 2019 citizenship law linked to NRC?\n\nThe NRC was updated in Assam recently — as part of a long-standing demand to identify those who have immigrated illegally, especially from Bangladesh, with 19 lakh people being excluded.\n\nThere is no overt connection between the two but they do feed into each other. In Assam’s context, the citizenship law means that of those left out of NRC, the Hindus will automatically get citizenship, leaving the Muslims out to take recourse to legal provisions.\n\nThis goes against the very basis of Assam’s anti-outsider movement and sentiment, that was religion-agnostic, and hence, the state has been up in arms.\n\nIn India’s context, Home Minister Shah’s constant pan-India NRC rhetoric has meant that this government has hyphenated it with the citizenship law, implying any citizenship determining process will have religious undertones.\n\nAlso read: Assam’s old 1970s fury back with Citizenship Act. This time for a new, young generation\n\nWhy are Indian Muslims angry with the law?\n\nTo answer it simply, the 2019 amendment Act is itself not a threat to the Muslim citizens of India. However, the real devil is in the details.\n\nBefore the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Home Minister Amit Shah made it clear that there will be a national NRC, similar to that of Assam. So, in this case, after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, when NRC is carried out, it is a given that there will be mass exclusions due to the process demanding papers establishing lineage, etc.\n\nAlthough, the exclusions are bound to include everyone from Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis to Muslims, all others barring Muslims will be saved by the 2019 citizenship law as it seeks to provide citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians of the neighbouring nations.\n\nBut Muslims, having no country to accept them and India having no provisions to grant them citizenship, could inevitably end up in detention camps.\n\nAlso read: This isn’t just about Muslims, say anti-CAA protesters in Delhi, blame police for chaos\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.

It's extremely worrying,\" he said.\n\nModi celebrated the bill's passing on Twitter. \"A landmark day for India and our nation's ethos of compassion and brotherhood!\" he wrote. \"This bill will alleviate the suffering of many who faced persecution for years.\"\n\nThe bill's passage has drawn widespread opposition and protests, especially in the northeastern states.\n\nMany indigenous groups there fear that giving citizenship to large numbers of immigrants, who came over the porous border with Bangladesh following independence in 1971, would change the unique ethnic make-up of the region and their way of life, regardless of religion.\n\nDemonstrators shout slogans as they hold placards to protest against the government's Citizenship Amendment Bill in Agartala in India's northeast state of Tripura.\n\nHindu nationalist agenda\n\nCritics of the bill say it is another example of how Modi and his BJP party have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people, at the expense of the Muslim population.\n\nThe BJP, which was re-elected in May, has its roots in India's Hindu right-wing movement, many followers of which see India as a Hindu nation.\n\nIn August, the Indian government stripped the majority-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomous status, essentially giving New Delhi more control over the region's affairs. That same month, nearly two million people in India's Assam were left off a controversial new National Register of Citizens, which critics feared could be used to justify religious discrimination against Muslims in the state.\n\nAnd last month, India's top court gave Hindus permission to build a temple on a disputed centuries-old holy site, which holds significance for both Hindus and Muslims. The ruling on the Ayodhya site was seen as a blow to Muslims and came at a time when Muslims increasingly see themselves as second-class citizens.\n\nIn 2018, India's Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were \"termites\" and promised to rid the nation of them.\n\nThe government maintains the bill is about protecting religious minorities who fled to India to avoid persecution by allowing them to become citizens.\n\nShah said in a tweet that the bill \"will allow India to open its doors to minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who are facing religious persecution.\"\n\n\"It is well known that those minorities who chose to make Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan their home had to constantly live in the fear of extinction,\" Shah said. \"This amended legislation by Modi government will allow India to extend them dignity and an opportunity to rebuild their lives.\"\n\nModi tweeted that the bill, \"is in line with India's centuries old ethos of assimilation and belief in humanitarian values.\"\n\nBut critics say India's claims that the citizenship law aims to protect religious minorities \"rings hollow\" because it excludes Muslim minorities who face persecution in neighboring countries, including the Ahmadiyya from Pakistan, Rohingya from Myanmar, and the Tamil from Sri Lanka.\n\n\"The bill uses the language of refuge and sanctuary, but discriminates on religious grounds in violation of international law,\" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement.\n\nAddressing parliament on Tuesday, Shah said that Muslims \"will not benefit from this amendment because they have not been persecuted on the basis of religion.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, he added: \"Who are you worried about? Should we make the Muslims coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan citizens of the country? What do you want -- that we give every Muslim coming from any anywhere in the world citizenship? ...

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f27532e953e2d0d883f362d"},"channel":"Google","query":"citizenship amendment act","text":"Despite the media and mass movements protesting India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, it does not strip any Indian of their citizenship. Rather, it provides refuge to persecuted minorities.\n\nIndependent India’s Citizenship Laws can be traced to 1955. The Citizenship Act provided citizenship to those born in India and offered two ways for non-Indians to obtain Indian citizenship: people from the rest of undivided India would become eligible to apply for citizenship after seven years of residency in India, whereas those from countries other than undivided India would become eligible after twelve years of residency in India. The Citizenship Act was amended in 1985 in the aftermath of the Assam movement and then subsequently in 1992, 2003, 2005, and 2015. The 2003 amendment in particular introduced the notion of “illegal immigrants” (defined as those without proper travel documents or those who had overstayed the term of their Indian visas) into the act and made them ineligible to apply for citizenship through registration or naturalisation. These illegal immigrants could be deported and/or jailed. The 2003 amendment also made it mandatory to ultimately compile a National Register of Citizens (NRC) – a move that was then supported by the Congress and Left parties. The latest amendment to the Citizenship Act came into being on 12 December 2019.\n\nWhat makes this latest amendment stand out is that it for the first time permits people from the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Christian communities, originally from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan (PBA), to apply for Indian citizenship if these people had arrived in India before 31 December 2014, i.e., they had been living in India for five years. The act specifically excludes Muslims. The constitutional validity of the act has been challenged in India’s Supreme Court.\n\nSections of the media (including international media) and some countries have objected to this act. Some people (particularly academics) have initiated signature campaigns against this act. In India, several rallies (some violent) have been held against this act. These rallies have largely been instigated by some political parties and fringe groups. It is not always clear what these groups are agitating for – denial of citizenship to minorities from PBA or award of citizenship to Muslims from PBA. Before passing judgement on the act, it would be necessary to understand its rationale.\n\nIn April 1950 the then-Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan (consisting of East and West Pakistan since Bangladesh had not been born then) entered into an agreement to protect minorities in their countries. The Nehru-Liaquat Pact (NLP) enjoined both countries to honour and protect the democratic, political, religious, cultural, and economic rights of their minorities. This pact had become necessary because although the partition of undivided India in 1947 was done along religious lines (it actually carved out the Islamic Republic of Pakistan whereas India opted for secularism), both countries had significant religious minorities. The 1937 and 1945-46 elections in India had been conducted with separate electorates for different communities. The 1937 election did not have the creation of Pakistan as an objective of the Muslim League whereas the 1946 election specifically had this objective. The contrast between the results of the two elections was stark. For example, the Muslim League failed disastrously in the 1937 elections, but in 1946 it won 75 of the 85 Muslim seats in Punjab.\n\nIn contrast, the Congress Party (mostly representing Hindus) won 58.23 percent of the total seats and 91 percent of the non-Muslim, vote whereas the Muslim League won 26.81 percent of the total seats. It captured all Muslim constituencies in the central assembly as well as most of the Muslim constituencies in the provincial legislatures. More than anything else, this vote led to the formation of Pakistan. But this could not obfuscate the fact that significant sections of the population in areas now in Pakistan voted for the Congress and significant sections of the population now in India voted for the Muslim League. In the mayhem and carnage of the partition, not all Indian Muslims migrated to Pakistan, nor did all Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan migrate to India. Using comparable census data from India and Pakistan, the proportion of the population with Indian religious (INR) persuasions (Hindu, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists) was 84.4 percent in 1941, 87.2 percent in 1951 (immediately after the partition) and 85 percent in 1991. The share of Muslims in India’s population was 13.3 percent in 1941, 10.4 percent in 1951 and 12.5 percent in 1991. By way of contrast in Bangladesh, 29.6 percent of the population was INR in 1941, falling to 22.8 percent in 1951 and 11.3 percent in 1991. In Pakistan INR population fell from 19.6 percent in 1941 to 1.6 percent in 1991 whereas the share of Muslims rose from 78.8 percent in 1941 to 96.7 percent in 1991(for details see chapter 2 of vol. 1 of Raghbendra Jha, Facets of India’s Economy and Her Society, Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). These disparities have grown further since 1991. The share of Muslims in India’s population was 13.4 percent in the 2001 Census and 14.2 percent in the 2011 census. Comparable figures are not readily available for Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nThis factual narration lays out the gross violation of the NLP by Pakistan and Bangladesh. In Pakistan in particular, the media has reported large scale kidnappings, conversions, and forced marriages of young women. In India, the Muslim population has grown steadily and its mean per-capita expenditure is not very different from that of the Hindu population (for details see chapter 9 of vol. 2 of Raghbendra Jha, Facets of India’s Economy and Her Society, Palgrave Macmillan). India has had Muslim Presidents, Vice Presidents, Governors, Chief Ministers, Chief Justices of the Supreme Court, and the like. It is very hard to make the accusation of systematic discrimination against Muslims in India stick.\n\nBy way of contrast, members of the minority community are facing dire conditions in PBA. They fear for their safety, dignity, and livelihood and, except for small pockets, are not economically prosperous. Their forefathers did not participate in India’s freedom struggle for their progeny to end up in such hardship. Major leaders of India including Mahatma Gandhi had promised to give these people Indian citizenship should they ever choose to move to India. Some of these minority groups have fled to India, given that India has had a long history of providing refuge to persecuted minorities (Chapter 9 of vol. 2 of Raghbendra Jha, Facets of India’s Economy and Her Society, Palgrave Macmillan, 2018).\n\nThe CAA does not take away any Indian’s citizenship. On the other hand, it provides refuge to persecuted minorities. This should be seen as a humane gesture. With a population of 1.3 billion, India does not have the capacity to absorb other persecuted groups. In any case, there are many other Muslim countries where persecuted Muslims from other counties could go. The path to Indian citizenship is open to Muslims from any country, including PBA.\n\nFinally, the act needs to be seen as positive discrimination much like the affirmative action policy of the US and the reservations for Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/ST) in India. Those who are agitating against the Indian CAA should perhaps pay heed to how much SC/ST and other deprived groups have benefited from such positive discrimination.\n\nProfessor Raghbendra Jha is with the Arndt-Corden Department of Economics, College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National University.\n\nThis article is published under a Creative Commons Licence and may be republished with attribution.","title":"India’s Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 - Australian Institute of International Affairs","author":["Professor Raghbendra Jha","Emeritus Professor Ramesh Thakur Faiia","Miriam Matejova","Stefan Parker","Peter Dauvergne","Amit Kumar Mishra"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/indias-citizenship-amendment-act-2019/","image":""}

Over the past six years, there have been clear political moves to fundamentally assault and redefine this Constitutional basis of both Indian nationhood and citizenship. Especially now, with the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 being passed and a not thoroughly debated all India-level NPR-National Register of Citizens (NRC) process. CJP is urging people to understand, organise and fight back democratically. Let’s stand up for the Constitution of India. We must unequivocally reject CAA 2019 and at the same time in the same breath, NPR/NRC. For this we need your support.\n\nINDIAN CITIZENSHIP:\n\nCitizenship gives us the right to have rights. Apart from voting rights, citizens are entitled to fundamental rights such as equality, freedom of speech, non-discrimination, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, etc. They have a right to permanently reside in India. Most state welfare schemes are only meant for citizens, e.g., MNREGA, reservation for SC/ ST / OBC people, food ration via the PDS, etc. Foreigners in India are only entitled to the fundamental right of life and personal liberty.\n\nIndian citizenship can be by birth, naturalisation, registration and annexation. In most of India, for citizenship by birth, from 1950-1987 a person has to be born here to be an Indian citizen; after 1987, apart from her/his birth, one of the parents has to be an Indian Citizen; after 2004, in addition to his/her birth, one of the parents has be an Indian Citizen and the other should not be an illegal migrant.\n\nDue to the Assam Accord, 1985, foreigners who had entered Assam before March 25, 1971, were to be given citizenship.\n\nPROBLEMS IN THE PROCESS OF THE NPR+NRC:\n\nThe fact that about 70% of the 19 lakh people who are out of the NRC in Assam are women shows that the method of asking people to furnish documents to prove their citizenship is incorrect at a very basic level – the NRC can only catch those who lack the required documents, not illegal immigrants. Even for rural-to-urban migration in India, the men move alone first and later try to bring women and children to the city, so it sounds impossible that there could be so many more female illegal immigrants than male ones. And now, the govt is planning to implement this disastrous NRC all over India!\n\nThe NPR is the first step of the proposed NRC (or NRIC). The NPR seems similar to the Census, but it’s not. The NPR comes under the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, while the census is conducted under the Census Act, 1948.\n\nThe process of the NPR, which leads to the NRC is as follows:\n\no For the NPR, govt employees will go to every home, collecting all the names and other details of every person living in India, whether citizen or foreigner.\n\no Then they will sit in their office, look at the information collected and decide who all seem to be “doubtful citizens”.\n\no Such “doubtful citizens” will then be asked to produce documents to prove that they are citizens.\n\no Decisions will be made about which of these “doubtful citizens” qualify to be Indian citizens.\n\no A ‘National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC)’ will be prepared.\n\no Those whose names appear in this list will be given a National Citizenship card.\n\no If you don’t have the card, you are not an Indian citizen!\n\nHighly bureaucratic and time-consuming process.\n\nTremendous power in the hands of the sarkari babus, who might be corrupt.\n\nAny person can raise objections on your inclusion in the NRC. This objection could be because of petty personal enmity, professional rivalry, discrimination due to your mother-tongue, caste, religion, etc.\n\nPrivacy of the census data is protected as per provisions of Census Act 1948. No such provision exists under NPR. The possible misuse of the data is a serious concern.\n\nPEOPLE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE NPR+NRC:\n\nWomen are the most vulnerable (more than 2/3 rd of the people out of the Assam NRC are women). Women often lack documents/ face problems of their documents not matching, because of the possibility of their:\n\nof the people out of the Assam NRC are women). Women often lack documents/ face problems of their documents not matching, because of the possibility of their: changing their names after marriage (in some communities, women even change their first names, not just surnames)\n\nnot being sent to school\n\nnot inheriting property\n\nshifting to other villages/towns after marriage.\n\nThe poor and uneducated of all communities, who lack documents.\n\nSC (approx. 23 crore Indians), ST (approx. 12 crore Indians) and OBC (approx. 55 crore Indians) who are often poor and thus might not have the required documents.\n\nNomads and Adivasis, who are often left out of the government’s documentation.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the21 crore Indian Muslims are poor, like SC/ STs. Very many of them may not have documents and they might have to face the lethal combination of CAA+NRC.\n\nOrphans and abandoned children, who might not have the required documents for themselves and their parents. There are 3.1 crore such children in India, according to the UNICEF.\n\nPeople from the LGBTQIA communities, including transgender people, who are often disowned by their families.\n\nAt least 42% (51.5 crore) of India’s population does not have a birth certificate. This includes elderly people who were born in an era when births were often not registered and people who are born at home/ rural areas where even now births are not registered.\n\nMigrant labourers.\n\nIlliterate people. For the more than 27 crore Indians who can’t read or write, it’s weird that a piece of paper can decide their destiny.\n\nDisabled people. Many of the disabled are abandoned, lack documents or have high probability of iris and thumbprint mismatch, say rights organisations. As per the 2011 census, 2.1 crore Indians are disabled, with 1.21 crore being illiterate. However, according to the World Bank, the number of disabled persons in India is much higher, between four and eight crore.\n\nPeople whose names are spelled differently in different documents, a mistake that is quite common in India, partly because of numerology. (In Assam, a man whose name was spelled as Sakhen Ali in one document and Saken Ali in another, had to spend 5 years in a detention camp.)\n\nPeople whose documents have been lost during calamities like floods or simply misplaced over the years. Some government offices’ records have been destroyed in floods and fires, or eaten by rats and termites, so it might not be possible to get duplicate copies from the government.\n\nWHY CAA IS CONSIDERED DISCRIMINATORY:\n\nCAA gives eligibility for Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians (i.e., non-Muslims) from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who reached India before 2015.\n\nCAA ignores persecuted minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar as well as Hazaras, Ahmadis, atheists and political dissenters, who face persecution in Pakistan.\n\nThis act is the first instance of religion being used as a criterion for Indian citizenship. CAA violates Constitutional secular principles and is a violation of Articles 13, 14, 15, 16 and 21 which guarantee the right to equality, equality before the law and non-discriminatory treatment by the Indian State.\n\nCAA is about illegal migrants. Citizenship via naturalisation or registration is not available to illegal migrants. There is no way for a Muslim who is declared an ‘illegal migrant’ to get citizenship in India.\n\nIndian Muslims could be badly affected by CAA+NRC, because those Muslims who do not have the documents required to prove their citizenship in a nationwide NRC could be declared as illegal migrants and they would not be able to use CAA, like non-Muslim Indians perhaps could, to get citizenship by lying and claiming that they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nPROBLEMS FOR NON-MUSLIMS TAKING CITIZENSHIP VIA CAA:\n\nThe NRC will affect people of all religions. Many non-Muslims are not worried about the NRC, because they think that if they are declared non-citizens because they don’t have the required documents, they can get citizenship via CAA by lying and saying that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They are not aware that it would not be so easy to get citizenship fraudulently via CAA. Even if a person manages to get citizenship via CAA by lying, it could mean a lifetime of insecurity. These are some of the problems which could crop up:\n\nHow can a Marathi manoos or a Malayali girl or a Tamilian man who don’t have the proper documents, and can’t speak Bengali, Urdu, Punjabi or Pashtu, claim to be from Bangladesh/ Pakistan/ Afghanistan? Some activists say that CAA 2019 – despite what the government implies – cannot or will not offer citizenship to non-Muslims who are Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati or Tamil speaking.\n\nQuestions and concerns regarding Reservations for SC/ ST/ OBC people:\n\no What would happen to Reservations for SC/ ST/ OBCs if the concerned person is out of the NRC and has to take citizenship via CAA?\n\no Would those who claim to be illegal immigrants from these 3 countries be eligible to get reservations?\n\no What is the proof that they belong to the caste that they claim to be from?\n\no If they do not have to supply even the basic proof that they actually belong to these 3 countries, what would stop say, a general category person from claiming that he is actually an illegal Dalit immigrant and thus eligible for reservations?\n\no Reservations are complex, politically charged matters. Different castes are eligible for reservations in various states and even districts of India, depending on the history and the politics of that place. The Supreme Court has ruled that a person belonging to SCs or STs in one state cannot be deemed to be a SC or ST in other states where he has migrated for the purpose of employment or education, saying that such persons would be eating away the quota meant for the native SCs or STs. E.g. Thoti is considered as a scheduled tribe only in Aurangabad, Jalna, Bid, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur, Parbhani and Hingoli districts and Rajura tehsil of Chandrapur district in Maharashtra. How would a Thoti person belonging to Rajura tehsil of Chandrapur fare if he/she has to lie and claim to be from Bangladesh?\n\no Some Bahujan activists allege that while CAA+NPR+NRC is openly anti-Muslim, the hidden agenda is to deprive poor SC/ ST/ OBC people of Reservations and disempower them.\n\nImagine your vulnerability and the power that anyone would have over you and your loved ones, including your female relatives, if you lie and say that you are an illegal immigrant.\n\nA sarkari babu, who could be corrupt, might have the power to decide whether or not you are eligible for citizenship via CAA if you do not have the required documents.\n\nHow can crores of people lie blatantly and say that they are from another country? If they are proved to be lying (as should be quite easy to do), what happens to them?\n\nIf you lie and say that you are an illegal immigrant, then all your life before the time you claim to have migrated might officially be nullified. It would, in some ways, be like you are actually a penniless refugee who is having to start life from square one.\n\nWhat happens to all your property, possessions, educational qualifications which are from before the time you say that you migrated to India?\n\nWhat happens to marriages that happened from before the time a person says that he/she migrated to India? Would the marriages be annulled? Would the children from marriages like these be considered illegitimate? What safeguards are there to prevent this from being misused?\n\nAncestral property (as opposed to self-earned property, which can be willed) can be given only to the descendants. Would you lose your ancestral property if you have to claim to be an immigrant?\n\nWhat happens to family ownership of companies, insurance, the right to inherit property which is not covered by a will, govt jobs on compassionate basis, even the right to continue staying in your parents’ rented property, etc., that come from being related to your family members if you say that you are an immigrant from any other country?\n\nIn case your child says that he/she is an immigrant from another country, how can you claim any legal rights for maintenance in your old age?\n\nWhat about a crime, like say rape, murder or even embezzlement, which has been committed before the time when the person says he/she migrated from a certain country? If the government legally accepts that the accused was not in the country when the crime occurred, how can he/she be prosecuted?\n\nIn case there is this large-scale state-sanctioned dishonesty, how much respect for the law would remain in the country?\n\nWhat if a subsequent government rolls back CAA after the NRC has been carried out? What would be the status of your citizenship and your life?\n\nWhat if the police or other officials decide to probe your claim of being an illegal immigrant, because of the state government, corruption, petty enmity or simple conscientiousness?\n\nAs a matter of self-respect, would you be okay with lying and saying that you are an illegal immigrant from another country? Would you be okay with denying that you are the child of your parents?\n\nWhy should the country be subjected to this nightmarish disruption, to this ‘cutting the nose to spite the face’?\n\nTHE FINANCIAL COST OF A NATIONWIDE NRC:\n\nThe Assam NRC cost Rs 1200 crores, over a 10-year period and employed around 52,000 people for a population of 3 crore people. It’s likely to cost more than Rs 55,000 crore just for the government to conduct the nationwide NRC for 134 crore people if we project the figures to a national level. (In comparison, the Indian government spends around Rs 65,000 crore on health and Rs 95,000 crore on education every year.)\n\nIndia’s current population is around 134 crore. If even 1% of them (1.34 crore) are declared illegal immigrants, it will cost around Rs 2 lakh crore (Rs. 22,00,00,00,00,000) to build detention centres for them.\n\nIt would cost the government thousands of crores every year to maintain these detention centres, to feed and keep imprisoned all those people who were earning a living and happily managing their homes by themselves.\n\nEvery Indian would have to pay for this in the form of direct and indirect taxes (even a packet of biscuits is taxed).\n\nThe loss of productivity of the accused and their families.\n\nThe government officials, the courts and the people who have to defend themselves and their loved ones would be spending their time in activity which does not create any usable service or good and thus be a drain on the economy.\n\nThe money which the common people will have to spend defending themselves. In Assam, which has a population of 3.2 crore people, this amount has been estimated at 11, 000 crore rupees till now and is expected to shoot through the roof as 19 lakh people have to spend for defending themselves in foreigners’ tribunals and the courts. Nationwide, just the 11,000 crore rupees can be projected to more than 5 lakh crore rupees.\n\nThe effect on the economy of the strife. So many crores of people who have not committed any crime are unlikely to meekly consent to their citizenship and rights being taken away and let business proceed as usual.\n\nPossible international economic sanctions on India. 50% of our GDP is currently from the external sector.\n\nPossible economic collapse.\n\nPOSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF CARRYING OUT CAA+NPR+NRC:\n\nThe immense suffering of crores of people.\n\nTremendous power would be concentrated in the hands of the government, right from the top to even petty sarkari clerks and police constables.\n\nCrores of people might be declared non-citizens just because they lack the required documents. They might be locked up in detention camps or allowed to continue living in India as non-citizens., deprived of all the fundamental rights and without the right to vote, get food via PDS, avail of MNREGA, etc.\n\nDisenfranchisement and dis-empowerment of the poor would result in governments being elected which would not have to bother about the interests of the poor. Amartya Sen won a Noble Prize for his theory that famines can never occur in democratic societies. Elected governments are attuned to the common people’s needs, because they have the strength to vote them out of power. So, at the time of drought, these govts take steps to prevent a famine.\n\nIndia has one of the highest rates of economic inequality in the whole world, with the wealth of India’s top 9 billionaires being equal to the wealth of the bottom 50% population. The NRC process which would disproportionately affect the poor, would make the Indian poor even poorer.\n\nIf non-citizens are not given free treatment in government hospitals and clinics, this would increase the incidence and spread of contagious diseases in the general population.\n\nCollapse of the economy.\n\nThe courts which are overburdened even now, would be swamped with cases, since the crores of people who are deemed illegal immigrants by the quasi-judicial Foreigners Tribunals would be able to file cases in High Courts and even appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIncrease in crime and a lack of respect for the law.\n\nLike the poem goes, apathy to other communities’ victimisation can lead to lack of support when it’s your turn to be victimised: “First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist./ Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew./ Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”\n\nPossibility of large-scale infiltration into India from neighbouring countries due to CAA leading to a security threat.\n\nIncrease in riots, terror attacks.\n\nSome people have compared these laws to the Nuremberg laws passed in Germany in 1935 which stripped Jews of their citizenship and warned that CAA+NPR+NRC could lead to a genocide similar to the Holocaust in which Jews were vilified, stripped of their citizenship, then taken away to concentration camps and finally killed in gas chambers. 6 million Jews were systematically murdered by the Nazis. When the Nazis staged pogroms against the Jews, Golwalkar, the then head of the RSS, called it the highest form of “race pride.” He praised Nazi Germany for “purging the country” of Jews. He called the Nazi racial policies — the Nuremberg Laws — “a good lesson for us to learn and profit by.” Golwalkar said that any Indian who is not a Hindu is a “traitor” and called it “treason” to be a non-Hindu in India. Modi calls Golwalkar his “guru worthy of worship”.\n\nPossibility of civil war.\n\nContempt in the world community for India.\n\nNegative effect on non-resident Indians all over the world.\n\nNegative effect on the Hindus who live in neighbouring countries.\n\nHostility, unhappiness and ill-will in society. Emotions are contagious, guilt tears into people and no man is an island.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO STOP CAA+NPR+NRC:\n\nRaise awareness about the issue amongst your family, friends, co-workers and neighbours. Convince them that CAA+NPR+NRC has the potential to be disastrous for us and should be stopped.\n\nProtest – don’t be silent & don’t be violent. There are groups of people protesting non-violently in various ways all over India and even internationally. Join them.\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, Telegram, YouTube and even TikTok have given all of us the power to raise our voices. Use social media against this disastrous plan. We can also use emails, smses, phone calls, blogs, online petitions, etc.\n\nVolunteer and contribute, in whichever way that you can, to groups and organisations which are working against CAA+NPR+NRC.\n\nFollow the call regarding non-cooperation with the process of the NPR if and when it is given by the groups agitating against CAA+NPR+NRC.\n\nContribute to the movement through your work, especially if you are a media-person, lawyer, politician, filmmaker, influencer, artist, social worker, etc.\n\nRight now, the fight against CAA+NPR+NRC is extremely urgent and important. Long-term, we have to work at transforming people and spreading the ideas of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity.\n\nConvince your state governments to pass resolutions against CAA, NPR and NRC in their assemblies and to file cases in the Supreme Court. The state government’s machinery is required to carry out the NPR. If the non-BJP states, which cover 57 % of the Indian population, do not implement the NPR, the nationwide NRC would become meaningless.\n\nWe, the people of India, successfully fought for independence against the mighty British Empire and we gave ourselves the Indian Constitution which is based on the values of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity. We will successfully fight against CAA+NPR+NRC using Gandhiji’s non-violent methods and protect our beloved Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution.\n\nThis article has been written by a group of activists, distilling material from articles published in various periodicals and CJP’s pamphlets.

The government is providing citizenship through the law, it is not taking back the citizenship of anyone\".\n\nOver a hundred security personnel were injured during violent demonstration against CAA, the strongest dissent against Prime Minister Modi since he first came to power in 2014. Over 2,000 people have been arrested and around 5,000 detained while protesting against the CAA.\n\nClearing misconception fuelled by the opposition regarding the CAA, the government has, on many occasions, clarified that the law has \"absolutely nothing to do with citizens of India\" as the rumour was raised that it is against the Muslim community and people belonging to the community residing illegally will be deported.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with the deportation of any foreigner from India,\" the government has said.\n\n\"The deportation process of any foreigner irrespective of his religion or country is implemented as per the mandate of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.\"\n\nWhy Is The Citizenship Act Controversial?\n\nUnder the law, India will grant citizenship to the six communities that Modi's government says have historically faced persecution in the three Muslim-dominated neighbours. The government says Muslims cannot be treated as persecuted minorities in those countries.\n\nCritics say the law discriminates against Muslims and undermines India's secular Constitution. They question why the law does not include Muslims fleeing Sri Lanka and Myanmar, which are majority Buddhist.\n\nWho Does The Law Leave Out?\n\nOpposition parties say the law is discriminatory as it singles out Muslims, who make up nearly 15 per cent of the population. The government says that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries, so Muslims cannot be treated as persecuted minorities.\n\nWho Could Suffer?\n\nRights groups say Modi-supporting lawmakers have cleared the bill to justify deportation of thousands of Muslims living in the northeastern state of Assam who are unable to provide documents to prove Indian citizenship.\n\nWhat Are The Discrepancies?\n\nThe law does not clarify why minority migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan are favoured over those fleeing Sri Lanka and Myanmar from where minority Muslims have sought refuge in India.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe law has been challenged in India's Supreme Court by a Muslim political party, lawyers and rights groups on the grounds that it violates the secular Constitution.

It amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities, who had fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014.[3][4] Muslims from those countries were not given such eligibility.[5][6][7] The act was the first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[7][a][b][c]\n\nThe Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the Indian government,[8][9] had promised in previous election manifestos to offer Indian citizenship to members of persecuted religious minorities who had migrated from neighbouring countries.[10][11] Under the 2019 amendment, migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, and had suffered \"religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\" in their country of origin were made eligible for citizenship.[4] The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalisation of these migrants from twelve years to six.[12] According to Intelligence Bureau records, there will be just over 30,000 immediate beneficiaries of the bill.[13][d]\n\nThe amendment has been widely criticised as discriminating on the basis of religion, particularly for excluding Muslims.[5][6] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called it \"fundamentally discriminatory\", adding that while India's \"goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome\", this should be accomplished through a non-discriminatory \"robust national asylum system\".[17] Critics express concerns that the bill would be used, along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to render many Muslim citizens stateless, as they may be unable to meet stringent birth or identity proof requirements.[18][19] Commentators also question the exclusion of persecuted religious minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.[18][20] The Indian government says that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh have Islam as their state religion and therefore Muslims are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\" there.[11][21] However, certain Muslim groups, such as Hazaras and Ahmadis, have historically faced persecution in these countries.[22][23][24]\n\nThe passage of the legislation caused large-scale protests in India.[25] Assam and other northeastern states have seen violent demonstrations against the bill over fears that granting Indian citizenship to refugees and immigrants will cause a loss of their \"political rights, culture and land rights\" and motivate further migration from Bangladesh.[26][27][28] In other parts of India, protesters said the bill discriminated against Muslims and demanded that Indian citizenship to be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants.[29] Major protests against the Act were held at universities in India. Students at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia alleged brutal suppression by the police.[30] The protests have led to the deaths of several protesters, injuries to protesters and police personnel, damage to public and private property, the detention of hundreds of people, and suspensions of local internet mobile phone connectivity in certain areas.[31][32] Some states have announced they will not implement the Act. The Union Home Ministry has said that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of the CAA.[33]\n\nBackground\n\nCitizenship law\n\nThe Indian Constitution that was implemented in 1950 guaranteed citizenship to all of the country's residents at the commencement of the constitution, and made no distinction on the basis of religion.[34][35] The Indian government passed the Citizenship Act in 1955. The Act provided two means for foreigners to acquire Indian citizenship. People from \"undivided India\"[e] were given a means of registration after seven years of residency in India. Those from other countries were given a means of naturalisation after twelve years of residency in India.[39] Political developments in the 1980s, particularly those related to the violent Assam movement against all migrants from Bangladesh, triggered revisions to the Citizenship Act of 1955.[40][41][42] The Citizenship Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord was signed, wherein the Indian government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi agreed to identify foreign citizens, remove them from the electoral roles, and expel them from the country.[43][44][45][46]\n\nThe Citizenship Act was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. In December 2003, the National Democratic Alliance government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 with far-reaching revisions of the Citizenship Act. It added the notion of \"illegal immigrants\" to the Act, making them ineligible to apply for citizenship (by registration or naturalisation), and declaring their children also as illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants were defined as citizens of other countries who entered India without valid travel documents, or who remained in the country beyond the period permitted by their travel documents. They can be deported or jailed.[49]\n\nThe 2003 amendment also mandated the Government of India to create and maintain a National Register of Citizens. The bill was supported by the Indian National Congress, as well as the Left parties, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)).[50][51][f] During the parliamentary debate on the amendment, the leader of opposition, Manmohan Singh, stated that refugees belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and other countries had faced persecution, and requested that the governments approach to granting them citizenship be made more liberal.[53][54][55] According to M.K. Venu, the formulation of the 2003 amendment discussed by Advani and Singh was based on the idea that Muslim groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan that had experienced persecution also needed to be treated with compassion.[55]\n\nImmigrants and refugees\n\nA very large number of illegal immigrants, the largest numbers of whom are from Bangladesh, live in India. The Task Force on Border Management quoted the figure of 15 million illegal migrants in 2001. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government stated in Parliament that there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants in India.[56] The reasons for the scale of migration include a porous border, historical migration patterns, economic reasons, and cultural and linguistic ties. Many illegal migrants from Bangladesh had eventually received the right to vote. According to Niraja Jayal, this enfranchisement was widely described as an attempt to win elections using the votes of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh.[43][58] An unknown number of Pakistani Hindu refugees live in India. An estimated 5,000 refugees arrive per year, citing religious persecution and forced conversion.[59][60][61] A much larger number of refugees, estimated at 5–13 million, have arrived from Bangladesh over the decades due to a variety of complex factors.[62][63]\n\nIndia is not a signatory to either the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol.[65] It does not have a national policy on refugees. All refugees are classed as \"illegal migrants\". While India has been willing to host refugees, its traditional position formulated by Jawaharlal Nehru is that such refugees must return to their home countries after the situation returns to normal.[66][67] According to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, India hosts refugees in excess of 456,000,[68] with about 200,000 from \"non-neighbouring\" countries hosted via the UNHCR.[66][69][g] According to Shuvro Sarker, since the 1950s and particularly since the 1990s, the Indian governments under various political parties have studied and drafted laws for the naturalisation of refugees and asylum seekers. These drafts have struggled with issues relating to a mass influx of refugees, urban planning, cost of basic services, the obligations to protected tribes, the impact on pre-existing regional poverty levels within India.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party activities\n\nThe \"detection, deletion and deportation\" of illegal migrants has been on the agenda of the BJP since 1996. In the 2016 assembly elections for the border state of Assam, the BJP leaders campaigned in the state promising voters that they would rid Assam of the Bangladeshis. Simultaneously, they also promised to protect Hindus who had fled religious persecution in Bangladesh. According to commentators, in the context of an effort to identify and deport illegal immigrants, the proposal to grant citizenship took a new meaning. Illegal migrants could be granted citizenship if they were non-Muslim, on the grounds that they were refugees; Muslims alone would be deported.[35]\n\nIn its manifesto for the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP promised to provide a \"natural home\" for persecuted Hindu refugees.[74] The year before the 2016 elections in Assam, the government legalised refugees belonging to religious minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh, granting them long-term visas. Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals belonging to \"minority communities\" were exempted from the requirements of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946.[75] Specifically mentioned were \"Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists,\" who had been \"compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\". Eligibility for the exemption was made contingent on a migrant having arrived in India by 31 December 2014.[76]\n\nThe BJP government introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] The bill stalled in parliament following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India. Opponents of the bill in Assam and the northeastern states of India stated that any migration from Bangladesh \"irrespective of religion\" would cause \"loss of political rights and culture of the indigenous people\".[78][79] According to Niraja Jayal, while the BJP had promised to grant Indian citizenship to all Hindu migrants from Bangladesh in its election campaigns during the 2010s, the draft Amendment bill angered many in Assam, including its own political allies because they view the amendment as a violation of the Assam Accord.[80] That accord promised to identify and deport all illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered the state after 1971, \"regardless of their religious identity\".[80] In 2018, as the draft of this Amendment was being discussed, numerous Assamese organisations petitioned and agitated against it. They fear that the Amendment will encourage more migration and diminish employment opportunities to the native residents in the state.[80]\n\nIn parallel to the drafting of an amendment to the 1955 Citizenship Act, the BJP government completed an effort to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam. The process for creating the NRC had been put in place by the Citizenship rules enacted in 2003, and had been implemented in Assam under Supreme Court supervision as a result of a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. This was mandated under prior peace agreements in northeast, and the Assam Accord in particular.[82][83] The updated register was made public in August 2019; approximately 1.9 million residents were not on the list, and were in danger of losing their citizenship.[84] Many of those affected were Bengali Hindus, who constitute a major voter base for the BJP; according to commentators, the BJP withdrew its support for the Assam NRC towards its end for this reason.[85][86][h] On 19 November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah, declared in the Rajya Sabha (the Upper House of the Indian parliament) that the National Register of Citizens would be implemented throughout the country.[89]\n\nLegislative history\n\nThe BJP government first introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] Although this bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian parliament, it stalled in the Rajya Sabha, following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India.[78][79]\n\nThe BJP reiterated its commitment to amend the citizenship act in its 2019 election campaign. It stated that religious minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs are persecuted in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries, and promised to fast track a path to citizenship for non-Muslim refugees.[90][91] After the elections, the BJP government drafted a bill that addressed the concerns of its northeastern states. It excluded Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, except for non-tribal cities exempted under pre-existing regulations. It also excluded tribal areas of Assam.[92] The Indian government, while proposing an Amendment, said, that its bill aims to grant quicker access to citizenship to those who have fled religious persecution in neighbouring countries and have taken refuge in India.[21][93][5]\n\nThe Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint parliamentary committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019 to Parliament. The Bill was taken into consideration and passed by Lok Sabha on 8 January 2019. It was pending for consideration and passing by the Rajya Sabha. Consequent to dissolution of 16th Lok Sabha, this Bill has lapsed.[94]\n\nAfter the formation of 17th Lok Sabha, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament.[78][95] The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019,[96] with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.[97][98][99]\n\nThe bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.[100][101] Those voted in favour included Janata Dal (United), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR Congress Party.[100][101]\n\nAfter receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act.[102] The act came into force on 10 January 2020.[1][103] The implementation of the CAB began on 20 December 2019, when Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya gave citizenship certificates to seven refugees from Pakistan.[104]\n\nThe Amendments\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, by inserting the following provisos in section 2, sub-section (1), after clause (b):[103]\n\nProvided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;[103]\n\nA new section 6B was inserted (in the section concerning naturalisation), with four clauses, the first of which stated:\n\n(1) The Central Government or an authority specified by it in this behalf may, subject to such conditions, restrictions and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, grant a certificate of registration or certificate of naturalisation to a person referred to in the proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2.[103]\n\nThe \"exempted\" classes of persons were previously defined in the Foreigners (Amendment) Order, 2015 (issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946):[76]\n\n3A. Exemption of certain class of foreigners. – (1) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before the 31st December, 2014 (a) without valid documents including passport or other travel documents and who have been exempted under rule 4 from the provisions of rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 [...]; or (b) with valid documents including passport or other travel document and the validity of any of such documents has expired, are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be [...].[76]\n\nThe Rules had been further amended in 2016 by adding Afghanistan to the list of countries.[105]\n\nExemptions were granted to northeastern regions of India in the clause (4) of section 6B:\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and the area covered under \"The Inner Line\" notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873.'.[103]\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Act has amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 to give eligibility for Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and who entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act does not mention Muslims.[106][107] According to Intelligence Bureau records, the immediate beneficiaries of the Amended Act will be 31,313 people, which include 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[16][108]\n\nUnder the act, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have lived in India during the last 12 months, and for 11 of the previous 14 years. The bill relaxes this 11-year requirement to 5 years for persons belonging to the same six religions and three countries. The bill exempts the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura from its applicability. It also exempts the areas regulated through the Inner Line Permit, which include Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.[109][110][111] The inclusion of Manipur in Inner Line Permit was also announced on 9 December 2019.[92]\n\nThe bill includes new provisions for cancellation of the registration of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) if there are any violations of the provisions of this act or provisions of any other law of India. It also adds the opportunity for the OCI holder to be heard before the cancellation.[103][78]\n\nExclusion of persecuted Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\n\nMuslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not offered eligibility for citizenship under the new Act.[5][6][112] Critics have questioned the exclusion. The amendment limits itself to the Muslim-majority neighbours of India and takes no cognisance of the persecuted Muslims of those countries.[70] According to The Economist, if the Indian government was concerned about religious persecution, it should have included Ahmadiyyas – a Muslim sect who have been \"viciously hounded in Pakistan as heretics\", and the Hazaras – another Muslim sect who have been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They should be treated as minorities.[22] India's minister of minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi defended the exclusion of the Ahmadiyyas by saying that India does not consider them as non-Muslims.[113] A landmark 1970 judgement from the Kerala High Court deemed Ahmadiyyas to be Muslims by the Indian law.[114] Naqvi added that India has provided refuge to different persecuted sects at different times, and Ahmaddiyas will not be forgotten.[113]\n\nPakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries that have modified their constitutions in recent decades to declare Islam their official state religion. Therefore, according to the Indian government, Muslims in these Islamic countries are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\". The government says that Muslims cannot be \"treated as persecuted minorities\" in these Muslim-majority countries.[21][11] The BBC says that while these countries have provisions in their constitution guaranteeing non-Muslims rights, including the freedom to practice their religion, in practice non-Muslim populations have experienced discrimination and persecution.[21]\n\nExclusion of other persecuted communities\n\nThe Act does not include migrants from non-Muslim countries fleeing persecution to India, Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka, and Buddhist refugees from Tibet, China.\n\nThe Act does not mention Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamils were allowed to settle as refugees in Tamil Nadu in 1980s and 1990s due to systemic violence from the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka. They include 29,500 \"hill country Tamils\" (Malaiha).[67][115]\n\nThe Act does not provide relief to Tibetan Buddhist refugees,[18] who came to India in the 1950s and 1960s. Their status has been of refugees over the decades. According to a 1992 UNHCR report, the then Indian government stated that they remain refugees and do not have the right to acquire Indian nationality.[116]\n\nThe Act does not address Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar. The Indian government has been deporting Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[23][117]\n\nRelationship to NRC\n\nThe National Register of Citizens is a registry of all legal citizens, whose construction and maintenance was mandated by the 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act. As of January 2020, it has only been implemented for the state of Assam, but the BJP has promised its implementation for the whole of India in its 2019 election manifesto.[118] The NRC documents all the legal citizens so that the people who are left out can be recognized as illegal immigrants (often called \"foreigners\"). The experience with Assam NRC shows that many people were declared \"foreigners\" because their documents were deemed insufficient.[119]\n\nIn this context, there are concerns that the present amendment of the Citizenship Act provides a \"shield\" to the non-Muslims, who can claim that they were migrants who fled persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the Muslims do not have such a benefit.[120][121][122][123] Such a claim may be possible only for people in the border states who have some ethnic resemblance to the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, but not to the people of interior states.[19][124] Muslim leaders have interpreted the CAA–NRC package in precisely these terms, viz., that the Muslims in the country would be targeted (by considering documents as insufficient) as potential foreigners, leaving out all non-Muslims.[19]\n\nIn an interview to India Today, Home Minister Amit Shah offered reassurance that no Indian citizen needs to worry. \"We will make special provisions to ensure that no Indian citizen from minority communities is victimised in the NRC process.\" But the Indian Express said that the purpose of the NRC is precisely to identify the Indian citizens. So these references to \"Indian citizens\" remain unexplained.[19]\n\nReception\n\nLocals protest against the CAB in New Delhi on 14 December 2019\n\nLocals and Jamia Millia Islamia students protest against CAA/NRC in New Delhi on 15 December 2019\n\nProtests\n\nThe passage of the Act triggered different types of protests and criticisms. Violent protests erupted in Assam, where the protesters maintained that the new provisions of this Act are against prior agreements such as the Assam Accord,[26][27] and that they would cause a \"loss of political rights and culture\". The India-Japan summit in Guwahati, which was supposed to be attended by Shinzō Abe was cancelled.[125][126] The UK, USA, France, Israel and Canada issued travel warnings for people visiting India's north-east region, telling their citizens to \"exercise caution\".[127][128][129]\n\nIn other parts of India, political and student activists protested that the law \"marginalizes Muslims, is prejudicial against Muslims\" and sought that Muslim migrants and refugees should also be granted Indian citizenship per its secular foundations.[28] The protesters demanded that the law should grant Indian citizenship to Muslim immigrants and refugees too.[29]\n\nProtests against the bill were held in several metropolitan cities across India, including Kolkata,[127] Delhi,[130][131] Mumbai,[100] Bengaluru,[132] Hyderabad,[133] and Jaipur.[130] Rallies were also held in various Indian states of West Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Bihar, Maharastra, Kerala and Karnataka.[127] 27 people were killed by police firing guns in the whole of India.[134][135]\n\nVarious cities around the world, including New York, Washington D. C.,[136] Paris, Berlin,[137] Geneva, Barcelona, San Francisco, Tokyo, Helsinki,[138] and Amsterdam, witnessed protests against the Act and the police brutality faced by Indian protesters.[139][140]\n\nStudents from various universities like Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, Nadwa College, Jawaharlal Nehru University, IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras, Jadavpur University, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, IISc, Pondicherry University, and IIM Ahmedabad also held protest. More than 25 student associations from all over India joined protest. On 15 December, police forcefully entered the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia university, where protests were being held, and detained the students. Police used batons and tear gas on the students. More than a hundred students were injured and an equal number were detained. The police action was widely criticized, and resulted in protests across the country.[141][142][143]\n\nMuslims all over India came out to protest the CAA–NRC package with a renewed assertion of their identity as Indians.[144] Muslim women started protest at Shaheen Bagh on 15 December 2019 start as an ongoing 24/7 sit-in peaceful protest.[145][146][147] The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have blocked a major highway[i] in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for more than 51 days now as of 5 February 2020.[148] On 24 February, violent clashes occurred during the North East Delhi riots in which seven people where killed and more than a hundred injured.[149] The death toll rose to 42 in 36 hours with 250 people getting injured.[150]\n\nIndian government response\n\nOn 16 December, after the protests entered the fifth day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm in a series of tweets saying \"No Indian has anything to worry regarding this act. This act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India\".[151][152] As CAA protests raised concerns on combined effects of CAA with NRC, the government has sought to downplay its narrative on NRC, with both the PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah stating that there has been no talk on pan-Indian NRC in their government for now, and neither the cabinet nor the legal department has discussed it.[153][19]\n\nConsidering Violence and damage to public properties during demonstration, on 19 December, police banned protests in several parts of India with the imposition of section 144 which prohibits the gathering of more than 4 individuals in a public space as being unlawful, namely, parts of the capital Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka, including Bangalore. Police in Chennai denied permission for marches, rallies or any other demonstration.[154][155] Internet services were shutdown in several parts of Delhi. As a result of defining the ban, thousands of protesters were detained, including several opposition leaders and activists such as Ramachandra Guha, Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sandeep Dikshit, Tehseen Poonawalla and D Raja.[156][157][158]\n\nRallies in support\n\nStudent groups such as those from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – a student wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, held rallies in support of the amended Citizenship Act.[159][160] Rallies in support of the Amendment Act were led by BJP leaders in West Bengal, who alleged that the state government blocked them. They also accused the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party members of misinforming the state's residents about the new law.[161] Similarly, some 15,000 people joined a BJP-organised rally in support of the Act in Rajasthan.[162] On 20 December 2019, scores of people held demonstrations in Central Park, Connaught Place, New Delhi in support of the Act.[163][164] Hundreds of people gathered in Pune, forming a human chain, in support of CAA, on 22 December.[165][166] ABVP members held a rally in support of CAA and NRC in Kerala.[167] Hundreds of citizens were out on the streets in support of the citizenship law in Bangalore.[168] Members of the Social Democratic Party of India, linked to the Islamist militant organization Popular Front of India, were paid Rs.10000 to attack leaders supporting CAA in Bengaluru according to the Police[169]\n\nRefugees\n\nHindu refugee families in Assam, living since the 1960s in a refugee camp and who had been denied Indian citizenship so far, said that the Amendment had \"kindled hope\" at first. They added that the recent protests against the Act and demands for its cancellation have made them fearful of the future.[170] In New Delhi, about 600 refugees from Pakistan living in a camp consisting of tiny shanties celebrated the new law.[171] A delegation of Sikh refugees who had arrived from Afghanistan three decades ago thanked the Indian government for amending the citizenship law. They stated the Amended law would allow them to finally gain Indian citizenship and \"join the mainstream\".[172]\n\nSome Rohingya Muslim refugees in India were not optimistic about the Amendment and feared they would be deported.[173][174] Other Rohingya refugees expressed gratitude at having been allowed to stay in India, but did not make any comments specific to the Act lest they provoke a backlash. They said that local police had asked them not to protest against the Act.[175]\n\nMore than 200 families have arrived in the Indian state of Punjab with all their belongings after the law was enacted.[176]\n\nPolitical and legal challenge\n\nThe bill was opposed by the Indian National Congress, who said it would create communal tensions and polarise India.[177] The Chief Ministers of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala and Rajasthan and union territory of Puducherry – all led by non-BJP governments – said they will not implement the law.[178][179][127] According to the Union Home Ministry, states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \"the new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it\".[33] Modi stated on 21 December that the NRC had only been implemented in Assam to follow a directive from the Supreme Court of India, and that there had been no decision taken to implement it nation-wide.[180]\n\nThe Indian Union Muslim League petitioned the Supreme Court of India to declare the bill illegal.[181][182] The royal family of Tripura also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the bill.[183] The first hearing by the Supreme Court of India on 60 petitions challenging the Act was on 18 December 2019. During the first hearing, the court declined to stay implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.[181] On 22 January 2020, around 143 petitions, including several petitions filed after 18 December 2019 were heard. Court again declined the request for stay. Bench, presided over by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde indicated that the matter may be referred to a larger bench. a as the next date of hearing.[184][185] The next hearing was scheduled on 21 April 2020.[186]\n\nThe foreign intelligence agency of India, R&AW, had expressed concern while deposing in front of the joint parliamentary committee, and had stated that the bill could be used by agents of the foreign intelligence agencies to infiltrate legally into India.[187] Former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon called the incident a self inflicted goal that has isolated India from the International community.[188]\n\nHarish Salve, former Solicitor General of India, said that the bill does not violate Article 14, Article 25 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.[189] He points out that Article 15 and Article 21 apply only to the entities which reside in India, not to those which want to enter India. Salve says that the bill doesn't violate secularism and describes it as a 'narrowly-tailored' provision that is designed to address a specific issue.[190]\n\nA group of prominent individuals and organisations from around 12 countries representing minorities of Bangladesh released a joint statement in which they described the Act as “humanitarian” provision through which India has \"partially fulfilled\" its obligations towards the minorities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.[191] The National Sikh Front – a group representing the Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir, stated that it supports the Act because it will help the Sikh refugees in India who left Afghanistan.[192]\n\nA petition opposing the bill was signed by more 1,000 Indian scientists and scholars.[193] The petition stated that \"The use of religion as a criterion for citizenship in the proposed bill\" was \"inconsistent with the basic structure of the Constitution\".[193] A similar number of Indian academicians and intellectuals released a statement in support of the legislation.[194] The petition stated that the act \"fulfills the long-standing demand of providing refuge to persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\".[195]\n\nInternational reactions\n\nThis act was denounced by both the Hindu and Sikh communities of Pakistan. In particular, it was rejected by the Pakistan Hindu Council, a representative body of Hindus in the country. Many lawmakers were vocal in voicing their protest over this legislation. These included Lal Chand Malhi, member of the national assembly from Pakistan's ruling party Tehreek-e-Insaf, and Sachanand Lakhwani, member of the provincial assembly of Sindh.[210]\n\nSupranational\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\n^ Sharma (2019) , p. 523: \"First, citizenship status biased towards religious identity is by no means a new idea....

Introduction RFC6698], CAA records are used as a part of a mechanism for checking PKIX certificate data. The distinction between the two specifications is that CAA records specify an authorization control to be performed by a certificate issuer before issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification control to be performed by a relying party after the certificate is issued. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 2]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC3647]. Certification Practices Statement (CPS): Specifies the means by which the criteria of the Certificate Policy are met. In most cases, this will be the document against which the operations of the Certification Authority are audited. See [RFC3647]. Domain: A DNS Domain Name. Domain Name: A DNS Domain Name as specified in [STD13]. Domain Name System (DNS): The Internet naming system specified in [STD13]. DNS Security (DNSSEC): Extensions to the DNS that provide authentication services as specified in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC5155], and revisions. Issuer: An entity that issues certificates. See [RFC5280]. Property: The tag-value portion of a CAA Resource Record. Property Tag: The tag portion of a CAA Resource Record. Property Value: The value portion of a CAA Resource Record. Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX): Standards and specifications issued by the IETF that apply the [X.509] certificate standards specified by the ITU to Internet applications as specified in [RFC5280] and related documents. Resource Record (RR): A particular entry in the DNS including the owner name, class, type, time to live, and data, as defined in [STD13] and [RFC2181]. Resource Record Set (RRSet): A set of Resource Records or a particular owner name, class, and type. The time to live on all RRs with an RRSet is always the same, but the data may be different among RRs in the RRSet. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 4]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC5280]. Relying Application: An application whose operation depends on use of a certificate for making a security decision. 3 . The CAA RR Type RFC5070]. The following example is a DNS zone file (see [RFC1035]) that informs CAs that certificates are not to be issued except by the holder of the domain name 'ca.example.net' or an authorized agent thereof. This policy applies to all subordinate domains under example.com. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 5]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC6546], or both: $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net\" . CAA 0 iodef \"mailto:security@example.com\" . CAA 0 iodef \"http://iodef.example.com/\" A certificate issuer MAY specify additional parameters that allow customers to specify additional parameters governing certificate issuance. This might be the Certificate Policy under which the certificate is to be issued, the authentication process to be used might be specified, or an account number specified by the CA to enable these parameters to be retrieved. For example, the CA 'ca.example.net' has requested its customer 'example.com' to specify the CA's account number '230123' in each of the customer's CAA records. $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; account=230123\" The syntax of additional parameters is a sequence of name-value pairs as defined in Section 5.2. The semantics of such parameters is left to site policy and is outside the scope of this document. The critical flag is intended to permit future versions CAA to introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for correct processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs that do not recognize the new semantics from issuing certificates for the indicated domains. In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as critical. Neither the example.net CA nor any other issuer is authorized to issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the 'tbs' property tag are understood. $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; policy=ev\" . CAA 128 tbs \"Unknown\" Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 6]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 4 . Certification Authority Processing Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 7]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC1035], bit 0 is the Most Significant Bit and bit 7 is the Least Significant Bit. Thus, the Flags value 1 means that bit 7 is set while a value of 128 means that bit 0 is set according to this convention. All other bit positions are reserved for future use. To ensure compatibility with future extensions to CAA, DNS records compliant with this version of the CAA specification MUST clear (set to \"0\") all reserved flags bits. Applications that interpret CAA records MUST ignore the value of all reserved flag bits. Tag Length: A single octet containing an unsigned integer specifying the tag length in octets. The tag length MUST be at least 1 and SHOULD be no more than 15.

On December 9, 2019, the CAB Bill was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha's Winter Session. President Ram Nath Kovind signed it on December 12. What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to fast-track citizenship for persecuted minority groups in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The six minority groups that have been specifically identified are Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis. The Bill aims to change the definition of illegal migrants. However, the Act doesn’t have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmedis who also face persecution in Pakistan. The beneficiaries of Citizenship Amendment Bill can reside in any state of the country and the burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Presently, the Constitution of India provides for citizenship by naturalisation – for people who have lived in India for the past 12 months and for 11 of the past 14 years. It also provides for people whose parents or grandparents were born in India to become Indian citizens. Who are illegal immigrants from India perspective? As per the Citizenship Act, 1955, an illegal immigrant is one who enters India with fake or forged documents and/or does not have a valid passport. A person who stays beyond the visa permit is also referred to as an illegal immigrant. When did the issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill come up? Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was seeking to topple the Congress-led UPA government, promised to grant citizenship to Hindus persecuted in the neighbouring countries. In the party's election manifesto, the BJP promised to give shelter to the Hindus and welcome the refugees. Which parties are against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and why? BJP's coalition partner Assam Gana Parishad has threatened to cut ties with the party if the Bill is passed. NGOs like Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti and students' organisation All Assam Students’ Union also have come forward in opposing the Bill. All Opposition parties, including the Congress and All India United Democratic Front, have opposed the idea of granting citizenship to an individual on the basis of religion. It is also argued that the Bill if made into an Act, will nullify the updated National Registration of Citizenship (NRC). Parties and activists opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 are of the view that it works against the cultural and linguistic identity of the indigenous people. Mizoram and other northeastern states, which have a diverse indigenous community, have urged the government not to table the new citizenship bill, saying it will open a \"floodgate” of illegal immigrants in the state. In January 2019, days after Union home minister Amit Shah announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill would be brought in parliament again, protests were held in Manipur, Nagaland and Meghalaya. The Nagaland and North East Forum of Indigenous People (NEFIP) claimed that it would seek the United Nations’ intervention if the Centre implements the Bill. Northeast protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Bill has divided India into protests and jubilations. While Hindu refugee communities across India are celebrating the government's move, a majority of Northeast remains on edge. Guwahati was the epicentre of anti-CAB protests. People in the north-eastern states fear that the Bill would change the demography of the states if it is passed as people of different cultures and languages will get citizenship of the country. Currently, the northeast is witnessing protests against Bangladeshi immigrants. Exemptions under Citizenship Bill 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill exempts certain areas in the North-East from this provision. It would not apply to tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura. This effectively means that Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram along with almost whole of Meghalaya and parts of Assam and Tripura would stay out of the purview of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Amendments for OCI cardholders According to the Citizenship Bill, a foreigner may register as an Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) if they are of Indian origin or their spouse is of Indian origin. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill entitles the OCI cardholders to benefits such as the right to travel to India, and to work and study in the country. What is the current status of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019? The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was referred to a joint select committee in 2016, after being discussed extensively in the Lok Sabha. Members of the parliamentary committee visited several parts of the northeastern states and discussed the Bill with various organisation. On January 8, 2019 the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha. However, before it could be tabled in the Rajya Sabha, the Bill lapsed on June 3, 2019, as the tenure of the Lok Sabha ended. The Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019 passed the Bill. However, the Opposition, which terms it 'unconstitutional', is likely to knock the Supreme Court of India's door to protest against the Bill. Meanwhile, protests in the north east, particularly in Assam continue.\n\nCitizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019\n\n\"Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;\".\n\n[Gazette notification dated December 12, 2019]An Act further to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 .

The case has been temporarily suspended because of the lockdown following the coronavirus crisis.\n\nBachelet's petition emphasises that sovereign power is not unfettered and that even decisions regarding citizenship have to conform to the principle of non-discrimination.\n\nIn February de Varennes and other UN special rapporteurs wrote an \"open letter\" to the Indian government expressing concerns about the discriminatory aspects of the CAA.\n\nThe letter highlights that the \"arbitrary\" exclusion of Muslims and other minorities from the NRC would \"perpetuate discrimination against them and perpetuate a climate of uncertainty, including fears of prolonged statelessness, detention or even deportation\".\n\n'Internal matter'\n\nThe Indian Ministry on External Affairs said that the CAA was an \"internal matter\" of the country and \"no foreign party has any standing on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty\".\n\nExperts warn that the CAA, coupled with the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), violates international law, specifically the prohibition on rendering people stateless.\n\nNearly two million people were excluded from a citizenship list in the northeastern state of Assam where the NRC exercise was concluded last year.\n\n\"What the NRC will create is a large group of stateless people, which in itself will run counter to the obligation in international law to prevent statelessness,\" Parvathi Menon, a lecturer at the Erik Castren Institute of International Law and Human Rights at the University of Helsinki, says.\n\nMenon says the Indian government has already violated its international obligations by \"returning\" many Rohingya, claiming that they were \"illegal' immigrants.

New Delhi, which considers the Muslim refugees a security threat, has vowed to deport them.\n\n'Doubtful citizen'\n\nAccording to Indian lawyer Shruti Panday, the NRC places the burden to prove Indian citizenship on the citizen, which could mean that \"every citizen becomes a doubtful citizen\". The impact on marginalised groups such as Muslims will be particularly detrimental, she says.\n\nThe Indian Constitution recognises the right to equality and the equal application of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which India is a signatory to, specifically prohibits arbitrary deprivation of nationality.\n\nThe purpose of Bachelet's intervention was to highlight the High Commissioner's concerns that the CAA does not comply with India's human rights obligations.\n\nThe citizenship law, passed last December, sparked nationwide peaceful protests largely led by Muslims, who fear millions of members of the community will be rendered stateless or disenfranchised. Dozens of people, mostly Muslims, have been killed in a police crackdown that has been criticised by rights groups.\n\nThe Supreme Court refused to strike down the legislation and gave the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi time to reply to pleas challenging the constitutionality of the CAA.\n\nSurinder Bhagat, a counseller at the Indian Embassy in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said the CAA does not take away the citizenship of any Indian citizen, including Muslims.\n\n\"The CAA also does not challenge the standard naturalisation process already permitted in Indian law. The process of obtaining citizenship remains open to people of all faiths and of all countries\", Bhagat told Al Jazeera in an email interview.\n\nBut in the third week of March, the Ministry of Home Affairs filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that preparation of the NRC was a \"necessary exercise for any sovereign country for mere identification of citizens from non-citizens\".\n\nIt emphasised that it is not \"taking away\" anyone's citizenship, adding that the CAA \"won't affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of people\".\n\nPriya Pillai, an international lawyer, said that the international community should \"keep the pressure on India\".\n\nPillai says she believes the UN High Commissioner's intervention is a signal of how seriously the issue of citizenship and potential statelessness is being taken by the international community.\n\n\"The impact on regional peace and security can also not be ruled out, especially if there is mass statelessness as a result of the law and policies being pursued\", says Pillai.","title":"Does CAA comply with India's human rights obligations?","author":["Mia Swart"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/holdstopping-stateless-challenge-india-citizenship-law-200312071917304.html","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/3/cfe9f7aa4218432b80329d458a4c29e5_18.jpg"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f27532e953e2d0d883f363d"},"channel":"Google","query":"CAA","text":"Protests have broken out across India, a few of them violent, against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. The Act seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. They will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. So far 12 years of residence has been the standard eligibility requirement for naturalisation.At the first hearing on petitions challenging the CAA, the Supreme Court declined to stay the contentious law but asked the Centre to file its reply against the petitions that say it violates the Constitution. The petitioners say the Bill discriminates against Muslims and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution. Here's a primer.The legislation applies to those who were “forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion”. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration. The cut-off date for citizenship is December 31, 2014 which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date. Indian citizenship, under present law, is given either to those born in India or if they have resided in the country for a minimum of 11 years. The Bill also proposes to incorporate a sub-section (d) to Section 7, providing for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force.Centre says these minority groups have come escaping persecution in Muslim-majority nations. However, the logic is not consistent – the bill does not protect all religious minorities, nor does it apply to all neighbours. The Ahmedia Muslim sect and even Shias face discrimination in Pakistan. Rohingya Muslims and Hindus face persecution in neighbouring Burma, and Hindu and Christian Tamils in neighbouring Sri Lanka. The government responds that Muslims can seek refuge in Islamic nations, but has not answered the other questions. Amit Shah says that the Bill would not have been necessary if the Congress did not agree to Partition on the basis of religion. However, India was not created on the basis of religion, Pakistan was. Only the Muslim League and the Hindu Right advocated the two nation theory of Hindu and Muslim nations, which led to Partition. All the founders of India were committed to a secular state, where all citizens irrespective of religion enjoyed full membership. Either way, this logic for the CAB also collapses because Afghanistan was not part of pre-Partition India.CAB won't apply to areas under the sixth schedule of the Constitution – which deals with autonomous tribal-dominated regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The bill will also not apply to states that have the inner-line permit regime (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram).Among the states in the Northeast, the outrage against CAG has been the most intense in Assam. While a chunk of these states have been exempted from the legislation, CAB overs a large part of Assam. The protests stem from the fear that illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, if regularised under CAB, will threaten cultural and linguistic identities of the state.The National Register of Citizens or NRC that we saw in Assam targeted illegal immigrants. A person had to prove that either they, or their ancestors were in Assam on or before March 24, 1971. NRC, which may be extended to the rest of the country, is not based on religion unlike CAB.The CAB ringfences Muslim identity by declaring India a welcome refuge to all other religious communities. It seeks to legally establish Muslims as second-class citizens of India by providing preferential treatment to other groups. This violates the Constitution’s Article 14, the fundamental right to equality to all persons. This basic structure of the Constitution cannot be reshaped by any Parliament. And yet, the government maintains that it does not discriminate or violate the right to equality.The President gave his assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on December 12, a day after it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. However, the home ministry has yet to notify the rules to operationalise the law. The notification of rules may now have to wait as a decision in this regard will be taken after seeking experts’ advice since the matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court.The petitions against the Act are listed for hearing on January 22. In case experts feel that the rules can be challenged on legal grounds, the government will wait till January 22. Since the apex court did not clamp a stay on CAA, the home ministry could notify rules about who all can apply for citizenship, notify the authority and state minimum requirements and cut-off date.","title":"What is CAA, Citizenship Amendment Act?

According to a July 17 news report in The Assam Tribune, that time period expired this June 18.\n\nAn earlier report in The Hindu had stated that that MHA had issued the notification on January 10, 2020, which would mean the time period had expired on July 10.\n\nThe MHA has not responded to the news reports yet.\n\nThe parliament had passed the amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, on December 10, 2019, following which the Narendra Modi government notified it in January 2020. As per the amendment, India will grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, Jains and Buddhists from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on grounds of religious persecution.\n\nAlso read: CAA Is Mired in Troubling Half-Baked Assertions and Partial Truths\n\nThe amendment was brought in to grant – for the first time in India – citizenship based on religion. This triggered massive protests in various parts of the country, including in Assam where the amended Act would violate one of the principal clauses of the Assam Accord of 1985, which was signed after six years of anti-foreigner agitation in that state bordering Bangladesh.\n\nThe Assam Tribune quoting “sources” said the MHA would have to now seek “fresh permission for extension of the time limit for another six months from the presiding officers of the Lok Sabha”. Once finalised, those rules would have to be put before both houses of parliament. “According to the parliamentary system, the subordinate legislation committee of the Parliament will scrutinise the rules to vet whether these were framed in conformity with the Act notified in the (official) gazette. There were instances in the past of subordinate legislation committee objecting to the rules and the government complying with the recommendations.”\n\nAccording to some news reports, due to the ongoing pandemic, there is uncertainty over the upcoming Monsoon Session of the parliament. However, reports said standard operating procedures are being readied to make the parliament session functional.\n\nAlso read: After Saying CAA Is ‘Internal Matter’, Centre Withholds Info on It Citing Foreign Ties\n\nThe report further pointed out, “[At present], the BJP does not have majority in the committee and may have to indulge in lots of back channel negotiations. The present subordinate legislation committee is headed by YSR (Congress) MP Raghu Kanupuru and there are 15 members, out of which non-NDA members are in majority.”\n\nThough YSR (Congress) had voted for the amendment in parliament, it has since backed out, terming it discriminatory.\n\nResponding to the news about the delay in finalising the rules for the implementation of the Act, Santanu Mukherjee, working president of Sara Assam Bengali Oikyo Mancha, told The Wire, “CAA is nothing but a lollipop sold to a lot of people. In Assam, it will only destroy communal harmony. If an Act was passed and quickly notified too, why couldn’t the rules be finalised within the stipulated time? It only shows that they want this issue to be politically alive.”\n\nMukherjee added, “Anyway, in Assam, most people won’t be benefitted. They have applied for inclusion in the updated NRC with documents. How can they suddenly say that they came from Bangladesh? And why should one say so when one is a genuine citizen of the country?”\n\nAs many as 19 lakh people failed to make it to the final updated NRC in the state readied in August 2019. An estimated 12 lakh Hindu Bengalis – often considered the BJP’s vote bank in the state – are believed to be among them.

Top Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) leaders who were at the forefront of the anti-CAA movement in Assam had been arrested under the draconian Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act – UAPA – and the National Investigation Agency under the MHA has accused many of them of having ‘Maoist links’.\n\nTwo of the student leaders of the Samiti have been released on bail after over seven months in custody.\n\nAlso read: Gauhati HC Grants Akhil Gogoi Bail in 3 Cases Filed by Assam Police\n\nAside from those arrests, various other anti CAA protesters were also nabbed by Assam Police.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f27532e953e2d0d883f3640"},"channel":"Google","query":"CAA","text":"Text Size: A- A+\n\nFour controversial issues associated with CAA have been seriously debated in Parliament and in public discussions. In order to understand the official positions and justification given by the [Narendra Modi] government on these issues, we examine the 2019 Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 (JPC Report). This report introduces us to those technical-legal points, which contribute to the political arguments of the ruling party.\n\nThe legal criterion for selecting the specific cases of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\n\nThe selection of three Muslim-majority countries to identify the persecuted non-Muslim minorities is the first critical question. The inclusion of Afghanistan in this list looks quite strange. Pakistan and Bangladesh were the outcome of the two partitions of the subcontinent in 1947 and 1971, which led to massive migration of population. These countries also share borders with India, which makes the question of illegal immigration politically relevant. However, the case of Afghanistan is different. It does not share borders with India and it did not have any direct political-historical continuity with the Indian republic.\n\nAlthough the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)did not spell out its legal criterion for selecting three specific cases, the official response revolved around the idea of religious persecution of religious minorities in these Muslim countries. This justification was also invoked to rationalize the inclusion of Afghanistan in this list. The JPC report clarified that ”a number of persons belonging to minority communities in Afghanistan have also come to India on account of religious persecution or fear of religious persecution. Hence, it was decided to include Afghanistan’ in the ambit. This religious persecution of non-Muslims was also seen in relation to the wider Indian interest in Afghanistan, as the report asserted that “there have been multiple attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan by the Pakistan…sponsored LET, Haqqani Network and Taliban’, hence…minority communities are facing …atrocities due to their Indian origin”.\n\nThe MHA, however, underlined that it did not ignore the plight of minorities in other neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The report emphasised that the government followed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) since 2011 for dealing with foreign nationals. The SPO, therefore, was a legal procedure available to all refugees in India, allowing them to reside in India as legal immigrant. These individuals may apply for Indian citizenship as per the rules spelt out in the Citizenship Act 1955.\n\nIn other words, there are six non-Muslim religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians) of three Muslim countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan)who areseparated from the others migrants. However, these six minorities do not become Indian citizens only on the basis of religious persecution. The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law notes that the CAA “does not directly confer citizenship on these persons (…) it merely provides (…) the opportunity to be considered for the grant of certificate of naturalisation”.\n\nThe CAA enables the illegal migrants belonging to six specified communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian Citizenship in two categories, Registration [Section 5 (1) (a)] and Naturalisation (Section 6). For this purpose, the Third Schedule of 1955 Act was also amended to reduce the residence requirement from eleven to five years. It simply means that the six non-Muslim minorities are given a particular kind of relaxation under the CAA.\n\nAlso read: Modi is sailing smooth now, but history won’t be kind to him\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions. Quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. Your support will define our work and ThePrint’s future. SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe idea of minority\n\nThe CAA 2019 does not use the term “minority”. Instead, it identifies six-non-Muslim communities. The naming of communities on religious basis actually goes against the established Constitution principles. The Constitution introduces terms such as minority, Schedule Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) as secular administrative categories. For instance, if a social group is culturally/religiously/linguistically distinct and numerically inferior, it might be recognised as a “minority”.\n\nIf a social group had experienced caste discrimination and/or untouchability in the past, it would be included in the ‘Scheduled Castes’ list. And, indigenous communities or tribes are to be officially recognised as ‘Scheduled Tribes’. Since minority, SCs, and STs (and later the Other Backward Classes, the OBCs) are conceived as open, secular, administrative templates, no social group, technically speaking, would become a permanent constituent of these official-secular classifications.\n\nThe JPC report also highlights this point. In fact, a constitutional expert criticised the CAA for not using the expression minority, arguing that:\n\nIf you want to be on the safer side, we would have to omit reference to religions like Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis etc. (…) if we use the term ‘persecuted minorities’ the purpose would be served. As compared to communities, minorities would perhaps be more useful from the legal and constitutional point of view.\n\nThe Legislative Department, however, did not subscribe to this view and justified the use of religious categories:\n\nUsing persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries instead of its current form may negate the objectives of the Bill. As there is a possibility for wider scope of interpretation, it may be construed to include other communities (religious or otherwise). Moreover, the aspect of ‘religious persecution’ would also be lost sight of.\n\nIt is obvious here that the official purpose of the CAA is to provide legitimacy to the idea of religious persecution. Interestingly, however, the term religious persecution is not included in the final text of the CAA, 2019. This strategic lapse requires some explanation. The process to enact the CAA, we must remember, began with an official notification issued in 2015. The six non-Muslim communities were given visa relaxation by amending the Visa rules. The term religious persecution was invoked in this notification as a legal plea in defense of the amendment.\n\nThe MHA and the Legislative Department forcefully argued that the CAA was based on the gazette notification of 2015, hence there was no need to use the term religious persecution in the text of CAA. The JPC accepted this rather vague explanation and did not ask a crucial follow-up question: if religious persecution could be used in an official administrative order as a legal plea, why couldn’t it be accommodated in the text of the bill presented for legislative scrutiny?\n\nAlso read: 93% Muslims view Hindus favourably, but only 65% Hindus view Muslims positively: Pew survey\n\nExclusion of Muslims\n\nThe CAA excludes Muslims in two ways. It highlights the persecution of non-Muslims in neighbouring Muslim countries and, at the same time, does not include Muslims in the list of preferred migrants. This exclusion is seen as a violation of Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 25 (Freedom of religion). The JPC also raised this question. The Legislative Department, however, made two broad arguments in defence of the constitutional validity of the CAA. First, it said the law was justified on the basis of a legal doctrine called reasonable classification.\n\nAccording to this doctrine, if there is a special law that is applicable only to a certain sections/groups, the court is entitled to ‘enquire whether the classification is founded on a reasonable basis…or is arbitrary’ (Emphasis added). The reasonableness of classification, in this sense, can only be questioned if a law violates the rights of other persons/communities, which are outside the scope of its legal ambit. The classification of migrants into persecuted minorities and others, by this logic, is called reasonable because it does not affect the rights of Muslim citizens in India.\n\nSecond, the Legislative Department said the CAA was also justified on the basis of freedom of religion (Art 25). It argued that this law aims to protect the religious rights of persecuted minorities seeking Indian citizenship. At the same time, it does not have any impact on the right to worship and religion of other Indian citizens, including Muslims. This line of reasoning actually finds a clear political overtone in the speeches of BJP leaders.\n\nThis legal defence of the CAA as a special law becomes unconvincing when it is read in relation to NCR and NPR. As already explained, NCR and NPR are inseparable constituents of the established legal framework of Indian citizenship. The classification of usual residents into citizens and doubtful persons gets a radically different interpretation after the enactment of the CAA. It is important to remember that unlike the NPR 2010 exercise, NPR 2020 aims to collect additional data such as Aadhaar card number and parents’ birthplace. It is mandatory for the usual residents to provide this information. However, if a resident fails to submit sufficient documents to the NPR officials, including the proof that his/her parents were/are Indian citizens, his/her citizenship may become doubtful. He/she would be listed in the ‘D’ category of the proposed NRC.\n\nThe government has not yet evolved any mechanism to deal with such cases. The CAA offers a clear cut answer to these ambiguities. It is easier for a doubtful Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian person/resident to apply for Indian citizenship even if he/she does not have sufficient documents. He/she may justify his/her application by citing the term religious persecution. However, a doubtful Muslim would eventually be treated as a foreigner as he/she is excluded from the list.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Modi categorically denied any relationship between CAA and the NRC-NPR, Home Minister Amit Shah explained the CAA-NRC-NPR chronology in his various speeches and interviews. He said:\n\nfirst we will pass the Citizenship Amendment bill and ensure that all the refugees from the neighbouring nations get the Indian citizenship. After that, NRC will be made and we will detect and deport every infiltrator from our motherland.\n\nIn another interview, he clarified that the purpose of the CAA and NRC was to deal with the problem of infiltrators at the national level:\n\nall the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christians, they will get citizenship (…) We want to walk up to them and give them citizenship. They wouldn’t be asked for any documents\n\nShah’s political explanation of the CAA-NRC-NPR actually goes against the legal-technical arguments presented by the MHA to JPC. In the backdrop of this apparent political clarification, the legal reasonableness invoked by the MHA to defend CAA (as a special law that deals with a special group of people—persecuted minority) becomes completely irrelevant.\n\nAlso read: Assam’s old 1970s fury back with Citizenship Act. This time for a new, young generation\n\nThe relationship between the Assam Accord and the CAA\n\nAs pointed out earlier, the Assam Accord has been an important political phenomenon that redefines the contours of citizenship framework in India. The CAA, broadly speaking, goes against the spirit of the Assam Accord in two ways: it modifies the cut-off date from 1971 to 2014; and at the same time, makes a distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim migrants. These changes offer an opportunity to non-Muslim migrants of Bangladesh to apply for Indian citizenship even if they had entered the state of Assam after 1971. The JPC, it appears, dealt with this issue delicately and asked the government to respect the sentiments of the people of Assam and the North-east:\n\nThe Committee feel that in view of the anxieties and concerns expressed by the civil society groups in Assam and other North-Eastern States, the State and Central Governments should formulate rules and regulations under this Clause (6A) to ensure that the identities of indigenous peoples are not threatened in any way by unintended consequences of the Citizenship Bill.\n\nThe final version of the CAA, it seems, accommodated these suggestions. Section 3(4) of the new Law makes it clear that the changes introduced by the new amendment will not apply to ‘tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura…and the area covered under The Inner Line’.\n\nThis edited excerpt has been published with the permission of The French Institute of International Relations.

(PTI Photo)\n\nWhat is Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019?\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) is an act that was passed in the Parliament on December 11, 2019. The 2019 CAA amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 allowing Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities who fled from the neighboring Muslim majority countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014 due to \"religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\". However, the Act excludes Muslims. Under CAA 2019 amendment, migrants who entered India by December 31, 2014, and had suffered \"religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\" in their country of origin, were made eligible for citizenship by the new law. These type of migrants will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalization of these migrants from eleven years to five. Why people are protesting against CAA?\n\nThere have widespread protests across the country including the national capital region and northeastern states against the CAA amendment. The protest in Assam and other northeastern states turned violent over fears that the move will cause a loss of their \"political rights, culture and land rights\" and motivate further migration from Bangladesh. The agitators say that new amendment in Citizenship Act discriminates against Muslims and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution of the country. Sects like Shias and Ahmedis also face persecution in Muslim-majority countries like Pakistan but are not included in the CAA. Questions were also raised on the exclusion of persecuted religious minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. What Central govt has to say about CAA?\n\nIn its defence, the Central govt has stated that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries therefore Muslims are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\" there. What is the status of petitions filed challenging constitutional validity of CAA?\n\nSeveral petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, including by RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi. Several other petitioners include Muslim body Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, All Assam Students Union (AASU), Peace Party, CPI, NGOs 'Rihai Manch' and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students have also approached the apex court challenging the Act. The top court has issued notice to the Centre and sought its response by the second week of January on a batch of pleas challenging the CAA. A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had fixed a batch of 59 petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, for hearing on January 22.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the country has seen violent protests against the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the national capital region and other parts of India.

This may also provide some clarity for framing the rules and procedures.\n\nSources said additional time to frame CAA rules was sought from the parliamentary panel last week, as the ministry was preoccupied with other matters, including managing the Covid-19 crisis, for the past few months.

According to a July 17 news report in The Assam Tribune, that time period expired this June 18.\n\nAn earlier report in The Hindu had stated that that MHA had issued the notification on January 10, 2020, which would mean the time period had expired on July 10.\n\nThe MHA has not responded to the news reports yet.\n\nThe parliament had passed the amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, on December 10, 2019, following which the Narendra Modi government notified it in January 2020. As per the amendment, India will grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, Jains and Buddhists from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on grounds of religious persecution.\n\nAlso read: CAA Is Mired in Troubling Half-Baked Assertions and Partial Truths\n\nThe amendment was brought in to grant – for the first time in India – citizenship based on religion. This triggered massive protests in various parts of the country, including in Assam where the amended Act would violate one of the principal clauses of the Assam Accord of 1985, which was signed after six years of anti-foreigner agitation in that state bordering Bangladesh.\n\nThe Assam Tribune quoting “sources” said the MHA would have to now seek “fresh permission for extension of the time limit for another six months from the presiding officers of the Lok Sabha”. Once finalised, those rules would have to be put before both houses of parliament. “According to the parliamentary system, the subordinate legislation committee of the Parliament will scrutinise the rules to vet whether these were framed in conformity with the Act notified in the (official) gazette. There were instances in the past of subordinate legislation committee objecting to the rules and the government complying with the recommendations.”\n\nAccording to some news reports, due to the ongoing pandemic, there is uncertainty over the upcoming Monsoon Session of the parliament. However, reports said standard operating procedures are being readied to make the parliament session functional.\n\nAlso read: After Saying CAA Is ‘Internal Matter’, Centre Withholds Info on It Citing Foreign Ties\n\nThe report further pointed out, “[At present], the BJP does not have majority in the committee and may have to indulge in lots of back channel negotiations. The present subordinate legislation committee is headed by YSR (Congress) MP Raghu Kanupuru and there are 15 members, out of which non-NDA members are in majority.”\n\nThough YSR (Congress) had voted for the amendment in parliament, it has since backed out, terming it discriminatory.\n\nResponding to the news about the delay in finalising the rules for the implementation of the Act, Santanu Mukherjee, working president of Sara Assam Bengali Oikyo Mancha, told The Wire, “CAA is nothing but a lollipop sold to a lot of people. In Assam, it will only destroy communal harmony. If an Act was passed and quickly notified too, why couldn’t the rules be finalised within the stipulated time? It only shows that they want this issue to be politically alive.”\n\nMukherjee added, “Anyway, in Assam, most people won’t be benefitted. They have applied for inclusion in the updated NRC with documents. How can they suddenly say that they came from Bangladesh? And why should one say so when one is a genuine citizen of the country?”\n\nAs many as 19 lakh people failed to make it to the final updated NRC in the state readied in August 2019. An estimated 12 lakh Hindu Bengalis – often considered the BJP’s vote bank in the state – are believed to be among them. The BJP has been promising citizenship to such people based on the CAA.\n\nAlso read: The Time Has Come For India to Recognise Why Assam Protests Against CAA\n\nThere may be legal tangles to such a step as most will have earlier claimed to be residents of the state prior to the formation of Bangladesh and prayed to be included in the updated NRC. The NRC was updated as per the exclusive citizenship cut-off year for Assam – March 23, 1971.\n\nThe July 17 Assam Tribune news report stated, “…with the COVID-19 scare, the committee may not be in a hurry to comply, landing the BJP in Assam in trouble to explain its position to the Bengali Hindu electorate.”\n\nAssam is due for assembly elections in April-May of 2021. Top Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) leaders who were at the forefront of the anti-CAA movement in Assam had been arrested under the draconian Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act – UAPA – and the National Investigation Agency under the MHA has accused many of them of having ‘Maoist links’.\n\nTwo of the student leaders of the Samiti have been released on bail after over seven months in custody.\n\nAlso read: Gauhati HC Grants Akhil Gogoi Bail in 3 Cases Filed by Assam Police\n\nAside from those arrests, various other anti CAA protesters were also nabbed by Assam Police.

It amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities, who had fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014.[3][4] Muslims from those countries were not given such eligibility.[5][6][7] The act was the first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[7][a][b][c]\n\nThe Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the Indian government,[8][9] had promised in previous election manifestos to offer Indian citizenship to members of persecuted religious minorities who had migrated from neighbouring countries.[10][11] Under the 2019 amendment, migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, and had suffered \"religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\" in their country of origin were made eligible for citizenship.[4] The amendment also relaxed the residence requirement for naturalisation of these migrants from twelve years to six.[12] According to Intelligence Bureau records, there will be just over 30,000 immediate beneficiaries of the bill.[13][d]\n\nThe amendment has been widely criticised as discriminating on the basis of religion, particularly for excluding Muslims.[5][6] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called it \"fundamentally discriminatory\", adding that while India's \"goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome\", this should be accomplished through a non-discriminatory \"robust national asylum system\".[17] Critics express concerns that the bill would be used, along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to render many Muslim citizens stateless, as they may be unable to meet stringent birth or identity proof requirements.[18][19] Commentators also question the exclusion of persecuted religious minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.[18][20] The Indian government says that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh have Islam as their state religion and therefore Muslims are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\" there.[11][21] However, certain Muslim groups, such as Hazaras and Ahmadis, have historically faced persecution in these countries.[22][23][24]\n\nThe passage of the legislation caused large-scale protests in India.[25] Assam and other northeastern states have seen violent demonstrations against the bill over fears that granting Indian citizenship to refugees and immigrants will cause a loss of their \"political rights, culture and land rights\" and motivate further migration from Bangladesh.[26][27][28] In other parts of India, protesters said the bill discriminated against Muslims and demanded that Indian citizenship to be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants.[29] Major protests against the Act were held at universities in India. Students at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia alleged brutal suppression by the police.[30] The protests have led to the deaths of several protesters, injuries to protesters and police personnel, damage to public and private property, the detention of hundreds of people, and suspensions of local internet mobile phone connectivity in certain areas.[31][32] Some states have announced they will not implement the Act. The Union Home Ministry has said that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of the CAA.[33]\n\nBackground\n\nCitizenship law\n\nThe Indian Constitution that was implemented in 1950 guaranteed citizenship to all of the country's residents at the commencement of the constitution, and made no distinction on the basis of religion.[34][35] The Indian government passed the Citizenship Act in 1955. The Act provided two means for foreigners to acquire Indian citizenship. People from \"undivided India\"[e] were given a means of registration after seven years of residency in India. Those from other countries were given a means of naturalisation after twelve years of residency in India.[39] Political developments in the 1980s, particularly those related to the violent Assam movement against all migrants from Bangladesh, triggered revisions to the Citizenship Act of 1955.[40][41][42] The Citizenship Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord was signed, wherein the Indian government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi agreed to identify foreign citizens, remove them from the electoral roles, and expel them from the country.[43][44][45][46]\n\nThe Citizenship Act was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. In December 2003, the National Democratic Alliance government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 with far-reaching revisions of the Citizenship Act. It added the notion of \"illegal immigrants\" to the Act, making them ineligible to apply for citizenship (by registration or naturalisation), and declaring their children also as illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants were defined as citizens of other countries who entered India without valid travel documents, or who remained in the country beyond the period permitted by their travel documents. They can be deported or jailed.[49]\n\nThe 2003 amendment also mandated the Government of India to create and maintain a National Register of Citizens. The bill was supported by the Indian National Congress, as well as the Left parties, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)).[50][51][f] During the parliamentary debate on the amendment, the leader of opposition, Manmohan Singh, stated that refugees belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and other countries had faced persecution, and requested that the governments approach to granting them citizenship be made more liberal.[53][54][55] According to M.K. Venu, the formulation of the 2003 amendment discussed by Advani and Singh was based on the idea that Muslim groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan that had experienced persecution also needed to be treated with compassion.[55]\n\nImmigrants and refugees\n\nA very large number of illegal immigrants, the largest numbers of whom are from Bangladesh, live in India. The Task Force on Border Management quoted the figure of 15 million illegal migrants in 2001. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government stated in Parliament that there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants in India.[56] The reasons for the scale of migration include a porous border, historical migration patterns, economic reasons, and cultural and linguistic ties. Many illegal migrants from Bangladesh had eventually received the right to vote. According to Niraja Jayal, this enfranchisement was widely described as an attempt to win elections using the votes of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh.[43][58] An unknown number of Pakistani Hindu refugees live in India. An estimated 5,000 refugees arrive per year, citing religious persecution and forced conversion.[59][60][61] A much larger number of refugees, estimated at 5–13 million, have arrived from Bangladesh over the decades due to a variety of complex factors.[62][63]\n\nIndia is not a signatory to either the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol.[65] It does not have a national policy on refugees. All refugees are classed as \"illegal migrants\". While India has been willing to host refugees, its traditional position formulated by Jawaharlal Nehru is that such refugees must return to their home countries after the situation returns to normal.[66][67] According to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, India hosts refugees in excess of 456,000,[68] with about 200,000 from \"non-neighbouring\" countries hosted via the UNHCR.[66][69][g] According to Shuvro Sarker, since the 1950s and particularly since the 1990s, the Indian governments under various political parties have studied and drafted laws for the naturalisation of refugees and asylum seekers. These drafts have struggled with issues relating to a mass influx of refugees, urban planning, cost of basic services, the obligations to protected tribes, the impact on pre-existing regional poverty levels within India.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party activities\n\nThe \"detection, deletion and deportation\" of illegal migrants has been on the agenda of the BJP since 1996. In the 2016 assembly elections for the border state of Assam, the BJP leaders campaigned in the state promising voters that they would rid Assam of the Bangladeshis. Simultaneously, they also promised to protect Hindus who had fled religious persecution in Bangladesh. According to commentators, in the context of an effort to identify and deport illegal immigrants, the proposal to grant citizenship took a new meaning. Illegal migrants could be granted citizenship if they were non-Muslim, on the grounds that they were refugees; Muslims alone would be deported.[35]\n\nIn its manifesto for the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP promised to provide a \"natural home\" for persecuted Hindu refugees.[74] The year before the 2016 elections in Assam, the government legalised refugees belonging to religious minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh, granting them long-term visas. Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals belonging to \"minority communities\" were exempted from the requirements of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946.[75] Specifically mentioned were \"Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists,\" who had been \"compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution\". Eligibility for the exemption was made contingent on a migrant having arrived in India by 31 December 2014.[76]\n\nThe BJP government introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] The bill stalled in parliament following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India. Opponents of the bill in Assam and the northeastern states of India stated that any migration from Bangladesh \"irrespective of religion\" would cause \"loss of political rights and culture of the indigenous people\".[78][79] According to Niraja Jayal, while the BJP had promised to grant Indian citizenship to all Hindu migrants from Bangladesh in its election campaigns during the 2010s, the draft Amendment bill angered many in Assam, including its own political allies because they view the amendment as a violation of the Assam Accord.[80] That accord promised to identify and deport all illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered the state after 1971, \"regardless of their religious identity\".[80] In 2018, as the draft of this Amendment was being discussed, numerous Assamese organisations petitioned and agitated against it. They fear that the Amendment will encourage more migration and diminish employment opportunities to the native residents in the state.[80]\n\nIn parallel to the drafting of an amendment to the 1955 Citizenship Act, the BJP government completed an effort to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam. The process for creating the NRC had been put in place by the Citizenship rules enacted in 2003, and had been implemented in Assam under Supreme Court supervision as a result of a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. This was mandated under prior peace agreements in northeast, and the Assam Accord in particular.[82][83] The updated register was made public in August 2019; approximately 1.9 million residents were not on the list, and were in danger of losing their citizenship.[84] Many of those affected were Bengali Hindus, who constitute a major voter base for the BJP; according to commentators, the BJP withdrew its support for the Assam NRC towards its end for this reason.[85][86][h] On 19 November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah, declared in the Rajya Sabha (the Upper House of the Indian parliament) that the National Register of Citizens would be implemented throughout the country.[89]\n\nLegislative history\n\nThe BJP government first introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[77][78] Although this bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian parliament, it stalled in the Rajya Sabha, following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India.[78][79]\n\nThe BJP reiterated its commitment to amend the citizenship act in its 2019 election campaign. It stated that religious minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs are persecuted in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries, and promised to fast track a path to citizenship for non-Muslim refugees.[90][91] After the elections, the BJP government drafted a bill that addressed the concerns of its northeastern states. It excluded Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, except for non-tribal cities exempted under pre-existing regulations. It also excluded tribal areas of Assam.[92] The Indian government, while proposing an Amendment, said, that its bill aims to grant quicker access to citizenship to those who have fled religious persecution in neighbouring countries and have taken refuge in India.[21][93][5]\n\nThe Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint parliamentary committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019 to Parliament. The Bill was taken into consideration and passed by Lok Sabha on 8 January 2019. It was pending for consideration and passing by the Rajya Sabha. Consequent to dissolution of 16th Lok Sabha, this Bill has lapsed.[94]\n\nAfter the formation of 17th Lok Sabha, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament.[78][95] The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019,[96] with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.[97][98][99]\n\nThe bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.[100][101] Those voted in favour included Janata Dal (United), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR Congress Party.[100][101]\n\nAfter receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act.[102] The act came into force on 10 January 2020.[1][103] The implementation of the CAB began on 20 December 2019, when Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya gave citizenship certificates to seven refugees from Pakistan.[104]\n\nThe Amendments\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, by inserting the following provisos in section 2, sub-section (1), after clause (b):[103]\n\nProvided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;[103]\n\nA new section 6B was inserted (in the section concerning naturalisation), with four clauses, the first of which stated:\n\n(1) The Central Government or an authority specified by it in this behalf may, subject to such conditions, restrictions and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, grant a certificate of registration or certificate of naturalisation to a person referred to in the proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2.[103]\n\nThe \"exempted\" classes of persons were previously defined in the Foreigners (Amendment) Order, 2015 (issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946):[76]\n\n3A. Exemption of certain class of foreigners. – (1) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before the 31st December, 2014 (a) without valid documents including passport or other travel documents and who have been exempted under rule 4 from the provisions of rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 [...]; or (b) with valid documents including passport or other travel document and the validity of any of such documents has expired, are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be [...].[76]\n\nThe Rules had been further amended in 2016 by adding Afghanistan to the list of countries.[105]\n\nExemptions were granted to northeastern regions of India in the clause (4) of section 6B:\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and the area covered under \"The Inner Line\" notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873.'.[103]\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Act has amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 to give eligibility for Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and who entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act does not mention Muslims.[106][107] According to Intelligence Bureau records, the immediate beneficiaries of the Amended Act will be 31,313 people, which include 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[16][108]\n\nUnder the act, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have lived in India during the last 12 months, and for 11 of the previous 14 years. The bill relaxes this 11-year requirement to 5 years for persons belonging to the same six religions and three countries. The bill exempts the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura from its applicability. It also exempts the areas regulated through the Inner Line Permit, which include Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.[109][110][111] The inclusion of Manipur in Inner Line Permit was also announced on 9 December 2019.[92]\n\nThe bill includes new provisions for cancellation of the registration of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) if there are any violations of the provisions of this act or provisions of any other law of India. It also adds the opportunity for the OCI holder to be heard before the cancellation.[103][78]\n\nExclusion of persecuted Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\n\nMuslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not offered eligibility for citizenship under the new Act.[5][6][112] Critics have questioned the exclusion. The amendment limits itself to the Muslim-majority neighbours of India and takes no cognisance of the persecuted Muslims of those countries.[70] According to The Economist, if the Indian government was concerned about religious persecution, it should have included Ahmadiyyas – a Muslim sect who have been \"viciously hounded in Pakistan as heretics\", and the Hazaras – another Muslim sect who have been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They should be treated as minorities.[22] India's minister of minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi defended the exclusion of the Ahmadiyyas by saying that India does not consider them as non-Muslims.[113] A landmark 1970 judgement from the Kerala High Court deemed Ahmadiyyas to be Muslims by the Indian law.[114] Naqvi added that India has provided refuge to different persecuted sects at different times, and Ahmaddiyas will not be forgotten.[113]\n\nPakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries that have modified their constitutions in recent decades to declare Islam their official state religion. Therefore, according to the Indian government, Muslims in these Islamic countries are \"unlikely to face religious persecution\". The government says that Muslims cannot be \"treated as persecuted minorities\" in these Muslim-majority countries.[21][11] The BBC says that while these countries have provisions in their constitution guaranteeing non-Muslims rights, including the freedom to practice their religion, in practice non-Muslim populations have experienced discrimination and persecution.[21]\n\nExclusion of other persecuted communities\n\nThe Act does not include migrants from non-Muslim countries fleeing persecution to India, Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka, and Buddhist refugees from Tibet, China.\n\nThe Act does not mention Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamils were allowed to settle as refugees in Tamil Nadu in 1980s and 1990s due to systemic violence from the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka. They include 29,500 \"hill country Tamils\" (Malaiha).[67][115]\n\nThe Act does not provide relief to Tibetan Buddhist refugees,[18] who came to India in the 1950s and 1960s. Their status has been of refugees over the decades. According to a 1992 UNHCR report, the then Indian government stated that they remain refugees and do not have the right to acquire Indian nationality.[116]\n\nThe Act does not address Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar. The Indian government has been deporting Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[23][117]\n\nRelationship to NRC\n\nThe National Register of Citizens is a registry of all legal citizens, whose construction and maintenance was mandated by the 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act. As of January 2020, it has only been implemented for the state of Assam, but the BJP has promised its implementation for the whole of India in its 2019 election manifesto.[118] The NRC documents all the legal citizens so that the people who are left out can be recognized as illegal immigrants (often called \"foreigners\"). The experience with Assam NRC shows that many people were declared \"foreigners\" because their documents were deemed insufficient.[119]\n\nIn this context, there are concerns that the present amendment of the Citizenship Act provides a \"shield\" to the non-Muslims, who can claim that they were migrants who fled persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the Muslims do not have such a benefit.[120][121][122][123] Such a claim may be possible only for people in the border states who have some ethnic resemblance to the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, but not to the people of interior states.[19][124] Muslim leaders have interpreted the CAA–NRC package in precisely these terms, viz., that the Muslims in the country would be targeted (by considering documents as insufficient) as potential foreigners, leaving out all non-Muslims.[19]\n\nIn an interview to India Today, Home Minister Amit Shah offered reassurance that no Indian citizen needs to worry. \"We will make special provisions to ensure that no Indian citizen from minority communities is victimised in the NRC process.\" But the Indian Express said that the purpose of the NRC is precisely to identify the Indian citizens. So these references to \"Indian citizens\" remain unexplained.[19]\n\nReception\n\nLocals protest against the CAB in New Delhi on 14 December 2019\n\nLocals and Jamia Millia Islamia students protest against CAA/NRC in New Delhi on 15 December 2019\n\nProtests\n\nThe passage of the Act triggered different types of protests and criticisms. Violent protests erupted in Assam, where the protesters maintained that the new provisions of this Act are against prior agreements such as the Assam Accord,[26][27] and that they would cause a \"loss of political rights and culture\". The India-Japan summit in Guwahati, which was supposed to be attended by Shinzō Abe was cancelled.[125][126] The UK, USA, France, Israel and Canada issued travel warnings for people visiting India's north-east region, telling their citizens to \"exercise caution\".[127][128][129]\n\nIn other parts of India, political and student activists protested that the law \"marginalizes Muslims, is prejudicial against Muslims\" and sought that Muslim migrants and refugees should also be granted Indian citizenship per its secular foundations.[28] The protesters demanded that the law should grant Indian citizenship to Muslim immigrants and refugees too.[29]\n\nProtests against the bill were held in several metropolitan cities across India, including Kolkata,[127] Delhi,[130][131] Mumbai,[100] Bengaluru,[132] Hyderabad,[133] and Jaipur.[130] Rallies were also held in various Indian states of West Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Bihar, Maharastra, Kerala and Karnataka.[127] 27 people were killed by police firing guns in the whole of India.[134][135]\n\nVarious cities around the world, including New York, Washington D. C.,[136] Paris, Berlin,[137] Geneva, Barcelona, San Francisco, Tokyo, Helsinki,[138] and Amsterdam, witnessed protests against the Act and the police brutality faced by Indian protesters.[139][140]\n\nStudents from various universities like Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, Nadwa College, Jawaharlal Nehru University, IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras, Jadavpur University, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, IISc, Pondicherry University, and IIM Ahmedabad also held protest. More than 25 student associations from all over India joined protest. On 15 December, police forcefully entered the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia university, where protests were being held, and detained the students. Police used batons and tear gas on the students. More than a hundred students were injured and an equal number were detained. The police action was widely criticized, and resulted in protests across the country.[141][142][143]\n\nMuslims all over India came out to protest the CAA–NRC package with a renewed assertion of their identity as Indians.[144] Muslim women started protest at Shaheen Bagh on 15 December 2019 start as an ongoing 24/7 sit-in peaceful protest.[145][146][147] The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have blocked a major highway[i] in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for more than 51 days now as of 5 February 2020.[148] On 24 February, violent clashes occurred during the North East Delhi riots in which seven people where killed and more than a hundred injured.[149] The death toll rose to 42 in 36 hours with 250 people getting injured.[150]\n\nIndian government response\n\nOn 16 December, after the protests entered the fifth day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm in a series of tweets saying \"No Indian has anything to worry regarding this act. This act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India\".[151][152] As CAA protests raised concerns on combined effects of CAA with NRC, the government has sought to downplay its narrative on NRC, with both the PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah stating that there has been no talk on pan-Indian NRC in their government for now, and neither the cabinet nor the legal department has discussed it.[153][19]\n\nConsidering Violence and damage to public properties during demonstration, on 19 December, police banned protests in several parts of India with the imposition of section 144 which prohibits the gathering of more than 4 individuals in a public space as being unlawful, namely, parts of the capital Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka, including Bangalore. Police in Chennai denied permission for marches, rallies or any other demonstration.[154][155] Internet services were shutdown in several parts of Delhi. As a result of defining the ban, thousands of protesters were detained, including several opposition leaders and activists such as Ramachandra Guha, Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sandeep Dikshit, Tehseen Poonawalla and D Raja.[156][157][158]\n\nRallies in support\n\nStudent groups such as those from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – a student wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, held rallies in support of the amended Citizenship Act.[159][160] Rallies in support of the Amendment Act were led by BJP leaders in West Bengal, who alleged that the state government blocked them. They also accused the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party members of misinforming the state's residents about the new law.[161] Similarly, some 15,000 people joined a BJP-organised rally in support of the Act in Rajasthan.[162] On 20 December 2019, scores of people held demonstrations in Central Park, Connaught Place, New Delhi in support of the Act.[163][164] Hundreds of people gathered in Pune, forming a human chain, in support of CAA, on 22 December.[165][166] ABVP members held a rally in support of CAA and NRC in Kerala.[167] Hundreds of citizens were out on the streets in support of the citizenship law in Bangalore.[168] Members of the Social Democratic Party of India, linked to the Islamist militant organization Popular Front of India, were paid Rs.10000 to attack leaders supporting CAA in Bengaluru according to the Police[169]\n\nRefugees\n\nHindu refugee families in Assam, living since the 1960s in a refugee camp and who had been denied Indian citizenship so far, said that the Amendment had \"kindled hope\" at first. They added that the recent protests against the Act and demands for its cancellation have made them fearful of the future.[170] In New Delhi, about 600 refugees from Pakistan living in a camp consisting of tiny shanties celebrated the new law.[171] A delegation of Sikh refugees who had arrived from Afghanistan three decades ago thanked the Indian government for amending the citizenship law. They stated the Amended law would allow them to finally gain Indian citizenship and \"join the mainstream\".[172]\n\nSome Rohingya Muslim refugees in India were not optimistic about the Amendment and feared they would be deported.[173][174] Other Rohingya refugees expressed gratitude at having been allowed to stay in India, but did not make any comments specific to the Act lest they provoke a backlash. They said that local police had asked them not to protest against the Act.[175]\n\nMore than 200 families have arrived in the Indian state of Punjab with all their belongings after the law was enacted.[176]\n\nPolitical and legal challenge\n\nThe bill was opposed by the Indian National Congress, who said it would create communal tensions and polarise India.[177] The Chief Ministers of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala and Rajasthan and union territory of Puducherry – all led by non-BJP governments – said they will not implement the law.[178][179][127] According to the Union Home Ministry, states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \"the new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it\".[33] Modi stated on 21 December that the NRC had only been implemented in Assam to follow a directive from the Supreme Court of India, and that there had been no decision taken to implement it nation-wide.[180]\n\nThe Indian Union Muslim League petitioned the Supreme Court of India to declare the bill illegal.[181][182] The royal family of Tripura also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the bill.[183] The first hearing by the Supreme Court of India on 60 petitions challenging the Act was on 18 December 2019. During the first hearing, the court declined to stay implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.[181] On 22 January 2020, around 143 petitions, including several petitions filed after 18 December 2019 were heard. Court again declined the request for stay. Bench, presided over by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde indicated that the matter may be referred to a larger bench. a as the next date of hearing.[184][185] The next hearing was scheduled on 21 April 2020.[186]\n\nThe foreign intelligence agency of India, R&AW, had expressed concern while deposing in front of the joint parliamentary committee, and had stated that the bill could be used by agents of the foreign intelligence agencies to infiltrate legally into India.[187] Former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon called the incident a self inflicted goal that has isolated India from the International community.[188]\n\nHarish Salve, former Solicitor General of India, said that the bill does not violate Article 14, Article 25 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.[189] He points out that Article 15 and Article 21 apply only to the entities which reside in India, not to those which want to enter India. Salve says that the bill doesn't violate secularism and describes it as a 'narrowly-tailored' provision that is designed to address a specific issue.[190]\n\nA group of prominent individuals and organisations from around 12 countries representing minorities of Bangladesh released a joint statement in which they described the Act as “humanitarian” provision through which India has \"partially fulfilled\" its obligations towards the minorities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.[191] The National Sikh Front – a group representing the Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir, stated that it supports the Act because it will help the Sikh refugees in India who left Afghanistan.[192]\n\nA petition opposing the bill was signed by more 1,000 Indian scientists and scholars.[193] The petition stated that \"The use of religion as a criterion for citizenship in the proposed bill\" was \"inconsistent with the basic structure of the Constitution\".[193] A similar number of Indian academicians and intellectuals released a statement in support of the legislation.[194] The petition stated that the act \"fulfills the long-standing demand of providing refuge to persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\".[195]\n\nInternational reactions\n\nThis act was denounced by both the Hindu and Sikh communities of Pakistan. In particular, it was rejected by the Pakistan Hindu Council, a representative body of Hindus in the country. Many lawmakers were vocal in voicing their protest over this legislation. These included Lal Chand Malhi, member of the national assembly from Pakistan's ruling party Tehreek-e-Insaf, and Sachanand Lakhwani, member of the provincial assembly of Sindh.[210]\n\nSupranational\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\n^ Sharma (2019) , p. 523: \"First, citizenship status biased towards religious identity is by no means a new idea....

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2803eec5428c9c9c9c42c2"},"channel":"Google","query":"CAA","text":"Text Size: A- A+\n\nFour controversial issues associated with CAA have been seriously debated in Parliament and in public discussions. In order to understand the official positions and justification given by the [Narendra Modi] government on these issues, we examine the 2019 Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 (JPC Report). This report introduces us to those technical-legal points, which contribute to the political arguments of the ruling party.\n\nThe legal criterion for selecting the specific cases of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\n\nThe selection of three Muslim-majority countries to identify the persecuted non-Muslim minorities is the first critical question. The inclusion of Afghanistan in this list looks quite strange. Pakistan and Bangladesh were the outcome of the two partitions of the subcontinent in 1947 and 1971, which led to massive migration of population. These countries also share borders with India, which makes the question of illegal immigration politically relevant. However, the case of Afghanistan is different. It does not share borders with India and it did not have any direct political-historical continuity with the Indian republic.\n\nAlthough the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)did not spell out its legal criterion for selecting three specific cases, the official response revolved around the idea of religious persecution of religious minorities in these Muslim countries. This justification was also invoked to rationalize the inclusion of Afghanistan in this list. The JPC report clarified that ”a number of persons belonging to minority communities in Afghanistan have also come to India on account of religious persecution or fear of religious persecution. Hence, it was decided to include Afghanistan’ in the ambit. This religious persecution of non-Muslims was also seen in relation to the wider Indian interest in Afghanistan, as the report asserted that “there have been multiple attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan by the Pakistan…sponsored LET, Haqqani Network and Taliban’, hence…minority communities are facing …atrocities due to their Indian origin”.\n\nThe MHA, however, underlined that it did not ignore the plight of minorities in other neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The report emphasised that the government followed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) since 2011 for dealing with foreign nationals. The SPO, therefore, was a legal procedure available to all refugees in India, allowing them to reside in India as legal immigrant. These individuals may apply for Indian citizenship as per the rules spelt out in the Citizenship Act 1955.\n\nIn other words, there are six non-Muslim religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians) of three Muslim countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan)who areseparated from the others migrants. However, these six minorities do not become Indian citizens only on the basis of religious persecution. The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law notes that the CAA “does not directly confer citizenship on these persons (…) it merely provides (…) the opportunity to be considered for the grant of certificate of naturalisation”.\n\nThe CAA enables the illegal migrants belonging to six specified communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian Citizenship in two categories, Registration [Section 5 (1) (a)] and Naturalisation (Section 6). For this purpose, the Third Schedule of 1955 Act was also amended to reduce the residence requirement from eleven to five years. It simply means that the six non-Muslim minorities are given a particular kind of relaxation under the CAA.\n\nAlso read: Modi is sailing smooth now, but history won’t be kind to him\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions.

SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe idea of minority\n\nThe CAA 2019 does not use the term “minority”. Instead, it identifies six-non-Muslim communities. The naming of communities on religious basis actually goes against the established Constitution principles. The Constitution introduces terms such as minority, Schedule Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) as secular administrative categories. For instance, if a social group is culturally/religiously/linguistically distinct and numerically inferior, it might be recognised as a “minority”.\n\nIf a social group had experienced caste discrimination and/or untouchability in the past, it would be included in the ‘Scheduled Castes’ list. And, indigenous communities or tribes are to be officially recognised as ‘Scheduled Tribes’. Since minority, SCs, and STs (and later the Other Backward Classes, the OBCs) are conceived as open, secular, administrative templates, no social group, technically speaking, would become a permanent constituent of these official-secular classifications.\n\nThe JPC report also highlights this point. In fact, a constitutional expert criticised the CAA for not using the expression minority, arguing that:\n\nIf you want to be on the safer side, we would have to omit reference to religions like Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis etc. (…) if we use the term ‘persecuted minorities’ the purpose would be served. As compared to communities, minorities would perhaps be more useful from the legal and constitutional point of view.\n\nThe Legislative Department, however, did not subscribe to this view and justified the use of religious categories:\n\nUsing persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries instead of its current form may negate the objectives of the Bill. As there is a possibility for wider scope of interpretation, it may be construed to include other communities (religious or otherwise). Moreover, the aspect of ‘religious persecution’ would also be lost sight of.\n\nIt is obvious here that the official purpose of the CAA is to provide legitimacy to the idea of religious persecution. Interestingly, however, the term religious persecution is not included in the final text of the CAA, 2019. This strategic lapse requires some explanation. The process to enact the CAA, we must remember, began with an official notification issued in 2015. The six non-Muslim communities were given visa relaxation by amending the Visa rules. The term religious persecution was invoked in this notification as a legal plea in defense of the amendment.\n\nThe MHA and the Legislative Department forcefully argued that the CAA was based on the gazette notification of 2015, hence there was no need to use the term religious persecution in the text of CAA. The JPC accepted this rather vague explanation and did not ask a crucial follow-up question: if religious persecution could be used in an official administrative order as a legal plea, why couldn’t it be accommodated in the text of the bill presented for legislative scrutiny?\n\nAlso read: 93% Muslims view Hindus favourably, but only 65% Hindus view Muslims positively: Pew survey\n\nExclusion of Muslims\n\nThe CAA excludes Muslims in two ways. It highlights the persecution of non-Muslims in neighbouring Muslim countries and, at the same time, does not include Muslims in the list of preferred migrants. This exclusion is seen as a violation of Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 25 (Freedom of religion). The JPC also raised this question. The Legislative Department, however, made two broad arguments in defence of the constitutional validity of the CAA. First, it said the law was justified on the basis of a legal doctrine called reasonable classification.\n\nAccording to this doctrine, if there is a special law that is applicable only to a certain sections/groups, the court is entitled to ‘enquire whether the classification is founded on a reasonable basis…or is arbitrary’ (Emphasis added). The reasonableness of classification, in this sense, can only be questioned if a law violates the rights of other persons/communities, which are outside the scope of its legal ambit. The classification of migrants into persecuted minorities and others, by this logic, is called reasonable because it does not affect the rights of Muslim citizens in India.\n\nSecond, the Legislative Department said the CAA was also justified on the basis of freedom of religion (Art 25). It argued that this law aims to protect the religious rights of persecuted minorities seeking Indian citizenship. At the same time, it does not have any impact on the right to worship and religion of other Indian citizens, including Muslims. This line of reasoning actually finds a clear political overtone in the speeches of BJP leaders.\n\nThis legal defence of the CAA as a special law becomes unconvincing when it is read in relation to NCR and NPR. As already explained, NCR and NPR are inseparable constituents of the established legal framework of Indian citizenship. The classification of usual residents into citizens and doubtful persons gets a radically different interpretation after the enactment of the CAA. It is important to remember that unlike the NPR 2010 exercise, NPR 2020 aims to collect additional data such as Aadhaar card number and parents’ birthplace. It is mandatory for the usual residents to provide this information. However, if a resident fails to submit sufficient documents to the NPR officials, including the proof that his/her parents were/are Indian citizens, his/her citizenship may become doubtful. He/she would be listed in the ‘D’ category of the proposed NRC.\n\nThe government has not yet evolved any mechanism to deal with such cases. The CAA offers a clear cut answer to these ambiguities. It is easier for a doubtful Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian person/resident to apply for Indian citizenship even if he/she does not have sufficient documents. He/she may justify his/her application by citing the term religious persecution. However, a doubtful Muslim would eventually be treated as a foreigner as he/she is excluded from the list.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Modi categorically denied any relationship between CAA and the NRC-NPR, Home Minister Amit Shah explained the CAA-NRC-NPR chronology in his various speeches and interviews. He said:\n\nfirst we will pass the Citizenship Amendment bill and ensure that all the refugees from the neighbouring nations get the Indian citizenship. After that, NRC will be made and we will detect and deport every infiltrator from our motherland.\n\nIn another interview, he clarified that the purpose of the CAA and NRC was to deal with the problem of infiltrators at the national level:\n\nall the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christians, they will get citizenship (…) We want to walk up to them and give them citizenship. They wouldn’t be asked for any documents\n\nShah’s political explanation of the CAA-NRC-NPR actually goes against the legal-technical arguments presented by the MHA to JPC. In the backdrop of this apparent political clarification, the legal reasonableness invoked by the MHA to defend CAA (as a special law that deals with a special group of people—persecuted minority) becomes completely irrelevant.\n\nAlso read: Assam’s old 1970s fury back with Citizenship Act. This time for a new, young generation\n\nThe relationship between the Assam Accord and the CAA\n\nAs pointed out earlier, the Assam Accord has been an important political phenomenon that redefines the contours of citizenship framework in India. The CAA, broadly speaking, goes against the spirit of the Assam Accord in two ways: it modifies the cut-off date from 1971 to 2014; and at the same time, makes a distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim migrants. These changes offer an opportunity to non-Muslim migrants of Bangladesh to apply for Indian citizenship even if they had entered the state of Assam after 1971. The JPC, it appears, dealt with this issue delicately and asked the government to respect the sentiments of the people of Assam and the North-east:\n\nThe Committee feel that in view of the anxieties and concerns expressed by the civil society groups in Assam and other North-Eastern States, the State and Central Governments should formulate rules and regulations under this Clause (6A) to ensure that the identities of indigenous peoples are not threatened in any way by unintended consequences of the Citizenship Bill.\n\nThe final version of the CAA, it seems, accommodated these suggestions. Section 3(4) of the new Law makes it clear that the changes introduced by the new amendment will not apply to ‘tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura…and the area covered under The Inner Line’.\n\nThis edited excerpt has been published with the permission of The French Institute of International Relations.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2803eec5428c9c9c9c42c4"},"channel":"Google","query":"CAA","text":"Protests have broken out across India, a few of them violent, against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. The Act seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. They will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. So far 12 years of residence has been the standard eligibility requirement for naturalisation.At the first hearing on petitions challenging the CAA, the Supreme Court declined to stay the contentious law but asked the Centre to file its reply against the petitions that say it violates the Constitution. The petitioners say the Bill discriminates against Muslims and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution. Here's a primer.The legislation applies to those who were “forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion”. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration. The cut-off date for citizenship is December 31, 2014 which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date. Indian citizenship, under present law, is given either to those born in India or if they have resided in the country for a minimum of 11 years. The Bill also proposes to incorporate a sub-section (d) to Section 7, providing for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force.Centre says these minority groups have come escaping persecution in Muslim-majority nations. However, the logic is not consistent – the bill does not protect all religious minorities, nor does it apply to all neighbours. The Ahmedia Muslim sect and even Shias face discrimination in Pakistan. Rohingya Muslims and Hindus face persecution in neighbouring Burma, and Hindu and Christian Tamils in neighbouring Sri Lanka. The government responds that Muslims can seek refuge in Islamic nations, but has not answered the other questions. Amit Shah says that the Bill would not have been necessary if the Congress did not agree to Partition on the basis of religion. However, India was not created on the basis of religion, Pakistan was. Only the Muslim League and the Hindu Right advocated the two nation theory of Hindu and Muslim nations, which led to Partition. All the founders of India were committed to a secular state, where all citizens irrespective of religion enjoyed full membership. Either way, this logic for the CAB also collapses because Afghanistan was not part of pre-Partition India.CAB won't apply to areas under the sixth schedule of the Constitution – which deals with autonomous tribal-dominated regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The bill will also not apply to states that have the inner-line permit regime (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram).Among the states in the Northeast, the outrage against CAG has been the most intense in Assam. While a chunk of these states have been exempted from the legislation, CAB overs a large part of Assam. The protests stem from the fear that illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, if regularised under CAB, will threaten cultural and linguistic identities of the state.The National Register of Citizens or NRC that we saw in Assam targeted illegal immigrants. A person had to prove that either they, or their ancestors were in Assam on or before March 24, 1971. NRC, which may be extended to the rest of the country, is not based on religion unlike CAB.The CAB ringfences Muslim identity by declaring India a welcome refuge to all other religious communities. It seeks to legally establish Muslims as second-class citizens of India by providing preferential treatment to other groups. This violates the Constitution’s Article 14, the fundamental right to equality to all persons. This basic structure of the Constitution cannot be reshaped by any Parliament. And yet, the government maintains that it does not discriminate or violate the right to equality.The President gave his assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on December 12, a day after it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. However, the home ministry has yet to notify the rules to operationalise the law. The notification of rules may now have to wait as a decision in this regard will be taken after seeking experts’ advice since the matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court.The petitions against the Act are listed for hearing on January 22. In case experts feel that the rules can be challenged on legal grounds, the government will wait till January 22. Since the apex court did not clamp a stay on CAA, the home ministry could notify rules about who all can apply for citizenship, notify the authority and state minimum requirements and cut-off date.","title":"What is CAA, Citizenship Amendment Act?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2803eec5428c9c9c9c42c6"},"channel":"Google","query":"CAA","text":"WHAT IS CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT ACT\n\n\n\nCitizenship Bill\n\nFollow\n\nThe Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019 passed the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act with as many as 125 MPs voting in favour of it and 99 against it. On December 9, 2019, the CAB Bill was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha's Winter Session. President Ram Nath Kovind signed it on December 12. What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to fast-track citizenship for persecuted minority groups in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The six minority groups that have been specifically identified are Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis. The Bill aims to change the definition of illegal migrants. However, the Act doesn’t have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmedis who also face persecution in Pakistan. The beneficiaries of Citizenship Amendment Bill can reside in any state of the country and the burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Presently, the Constitution of India provides for citizenship by naturalisation – for people who have lived in India for the past 12 months and for 11 of the past 14 years. It also provides for people whose parents or grandparents were born in India to become Indian citizens. Who are illegal immigrants from India perspective? As per the Citizenship Act, 1955, an illegal immigrant is one who enters India with fake or forged documents and/or does not have a valid passport. A person who stays beyond the visa permit is also referred to as an illegal immigrant. When did the issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill come up? Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was seeking to topple the Congress-led UPA government, promised to grant citizenship to Hindus persecuted in the neighbouring countries. In the party's election manifesto, the BJP promised to give shelter to the Hindus and welcome the refugees. Which parties are against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and why? BJP's coalition partner Assam Gana Parishad has threatened to cut ties with the party if the Bill is passed. NGOs like Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti and students' organisation All Assam Students’ Union also have come forward in opposing the Bill. All Opposition parties, including the Congress and All India United Democratic Front, have opposed the idea of granting citizenship to an individual on the basis of religion. It is also argued that the Bill if made into an Act, will nullify the updated National Registration of Citizenship (NRC). Parties and activists opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 are of the view that it works against the cultural and linguistic identity of the indigenous people. Mizoram and other northeastern states, which have a diverse indigenous community, have urged the government not to table the new citizenship bill, saying it will open a \"floodgate” of illegal immigrants in the state. In January 2019, days after Union home minister Amit Shah announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill would be brought in parliament again, protests were held in Manipur, Nagaland and Meghalaya. The Nagaland and North East Forum of Indigenous People (NEFIP) claimed that it would seek the United Nations’ intervention if the Centre implements the Bill. Northeast protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 The Bill has divided India into protests and jubilations. While Hindu refugee communities across India are celebrating the government's move, a majority of Northeast remains on edge. Guwahati was the epicentre of anti-CAB protests. People in the north-eastern states fear that the Bill would change the demography of the states if it is passed as people of different cultures and languages will get citizenship of the country. Currently, the northeast is witnessing protests against Bangladeshi immigrants. Exemptions under Citizenship Bill 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill exempts certain areas in the North-East from this provision. It would not apply to tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura. This effectively means that Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram along with almost whole of Meghalaya and parts of Assam and Tripura would stay out of the purview of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Amendments for OCI cardholders According to the Citizenship Bill, a foreigner may register as an Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) if they are of Indian origin or their spouse is of Indian origin. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill entitles the OCI cardholders to benefits such as the right to travel to India, and to work and study in the country. What is the current status of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019? The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was referred to a joint select committee in 2016, after being discussed extensively in the Lok Sabha. Members of the parliamentary committee visited several parts of the northeastern states and discussed the Bill with various organisation. On January 8, 2019 the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha. However, before it could be tabled in the Rajya Sabha, the Bill lapsed on June 3, 2019, as the tenure of the Lok Sabha ended. The Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019 passed the Bill. However, the Opposition, which terms it 'unconstitutional', is likely to knock the Supreme Court of India's door to protest against the Bill. Meanwhile, protests in the north east, particularly in Assam continue.\n\nCitizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019\n\n\"Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;\".\n\n[Gazette notification dated December 12, 2019]An Act further to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 .

Introduction RFC6698], CAA records are used as a part of a mechanism for checking PKIX certificate data. The distinction between the two specifications is that CAA records specify an authorization control to be performed by a certificate issuer before issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification control to be performed by a relying party after the certificate is issued. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 2]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC3647]. Certification Practices Statement (CPS): Specifies the means by which the criteria of the Certificate Policy are met. In most cases, this will be the document against which the operations of the Certification Authority are audited. See [RFC3647]. Domain: A DNS Domain Name. Domain Name: A DNS Domain Name as specified in [STD13]. Domain Name System (DNS): The Internet naming system specified in [STD13]. DNS Security (DNSSEC): Extensions to the DNS that provide authentication services as specified in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC5155], and revisions. Issuer: An entity that issues certificates. See [RFC5280]. Property: The tag-value portion of a CAA Resource Record. Property Tag: The tag portion of a CAA Resource Record. Property Value: The value portion of a CAA Resource Record. Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX): Standards and specifications issued by the IETF that apply the [X.509] certificate standards specified by the ITU to Internet applications as specified in [RFC5280] and related documents. Resource Record (RR): A particular entry in the DNS including the owner name, class, type, time to live, and data, as defined in [STD13] and [RFC2181]. Resource Record Set (RRSet): A set of Resource Records or a particular owner name, class, and type. The time to live on all RRs with an RRSet is always the same, but the data may be different among RRs in the RRSet. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 4]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC5280]. Relying Application: An application whose operation depends on use of a certificate for making a security decision. 3 . The CAA RR Type RFC5070]. The following example is a DNS zone file (see [RFC1035]) that informs CAs that certificates are not to be issued except by the holder of the domain name 'ca.example.net' or an authorized agent thereof. This policy applies to all subordinate domains under example.com. Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 5]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC6546], or both: $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net\" . CAA 0 iodef \"mailto:security@example.com\" . CAA 0 iodef \"http://iodef.example.com/\" A certificate issuer MAY specify additional parameters that allow customers to specify additional parameters governing certificate issuance. This might be the Certificate Policy under which the certificate is to be issued, the authentication process to be used might be specified, or an account number specified by the CA to enable these parameters to be retrieved. For example, the CA 'ca.example.net' has requested its customer 'example.com' to specify the CA's account number '230123' in each of the customer's CAA records. $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; account=230123\" The syntax of additional parameters is a sequence of name-value pairs as defined in Section 5.2. The semantics of such parameters is left to site policy and is outside the scope of this document. The critical flag is intended to permit future versions CAA to introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for correct processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs that do not recognize the new semantics from issuing certificates for the indicated domains. In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as critical. Neither the example.net CA nor any other issuer is authorized to issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the 'tbs' property tag are understood. $ORIGIN example.com . CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; policy=ev\" . CAA 128 tbs \"Unknown\" Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 6]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 4 . Certification Authority Processing Hallam-Baker & Stradling Standards Track [Page 7]\n\nRFC 6844 Certification Authority Authorization January 2013 RFC1035], bit 0 is the Most Significant Bit and bit 7 is the Least Significant Bit. Thus, the Flags value 1 means that bit 7 is set while a value of 128 means that bit 0 is set according to this convention. All other bit positions are reserved for future use. To ensure compatibility with future extensions to CAA, DNS records compliant with this version of the CAA specification MUST clear (set to \"0\") all reserved flags bits. Applications that interpret CAA records MUST ignore the value of all reserved flag bits. Tag Length: A single octet containing an unsigned integer specifying the tag length in octets. The tag length MUST be at least 1 and SHOULD be no more than 15.

The case has been temporarily suspended because of the lockdown following the coronavirus crisis.\n\nBachelet's petition emphasises that sovereign power is not unfettered and that even decisions regarding citizenship have to conform to the principle of non-discrimination.\n\nIn February de Varennes and other UN special rapporteurs wrote an \"open letter\" to the Indian government expressing concerns about the discriminatory aspects of the CAA.\n\nThe letter highlights that the \"arbitrary\" exclusion of Muslims and other minorities from the NRC would \"perpetuate discrimination against them and perpetuate a climate of uncertainty, including fears of prolonged statelessness, detention or even deportation\".\n\n'Internal matter'\n\nThe Indian Ministry on External Affairs said that the CAA was an \"internal matter\" of the country and \"no foreign party has any standing on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty\".\n\nExperts warn that the CAA, coupled with the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), violates international law, specifically the prohibition on rendering people stateless.\n\nNearly two million people were excluded from a citizenship list in the northeastern state of Assam where the NRC exercise was concluded last year.\n\n\"What the NRC will create is a large group of stateless people, which in itself will run counter to the obligation in international law to prevent statelessness,\" Parvathi Menon, a lecturer at the Erik Castren Institute of International Law and Human Rights at the University of Helsinki, says.\n\nMenon says the Indian government has already violated its international obligations by \"returning\" many Rohingya, claiming that they were \"illegal' immigrants. Menon points to the position in Assam where \"illegal immigrants\" are now being housed in detention centres.\n\nIndia's Hindu nationalist government has deported some Rohingya refugees to Myanmar in violation of the principles of non-refoulement under refugee law. New Delhi, which considers the Muslim refugees a security threat, has vowed to deport them.\n\n'Doubtful citizen'\n\nAccording to Indian lawyer Shruti Panday, the NRC places the burden to prove Indian citizenship on the citizen, which could mean that \"every citizen becomes a doubtful citizen\". The impact on marginalised groups such as Muslims will be particularly detrimental, she says.\n\nThe Indian Constitution recognises the right to equality and the equal application of the law. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which India is a signatory to, specifically prohibits arbitrary deprivation of nationality.\n\nThe purpose of Bachelet's intervention was to highlight the High Commissioner's concerns that the CAA does not comply with India's human rights obligations.\n\nThe citizenship law, passed last December, sparked nationwide peaceful protests largely led by Muslims, who fear millions of members of the community will be rendered stateless or disenfranchised. Dozens of people, mostly Muslims, have been killed in a police crackdown that has been criticised by rights groups.\n\nThe Supreme Court refused to strike down the legislation and gave the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi time to reply to pleas challenging the constitutionality of the CAA.\n\nSurinder Bhagat, a counseller at the Indian Embassy in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said the CAA does not take away the citizenship of any Indian citizen, including Muslims.\n\n\"The CAA also does not challenge the standard naturalisation process already permitted in Indian law. The process of obtaining citizenship remains open to people of all faiths and of all countries\", Bhagat told Al Jazeera in an email interview.\n\nBut in the third week of March, the Ministry of Home Affairs filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that preparation of the NRC was a \"necessary exercise for any sovereign country for mere identification of citizens from non-citizens\".\n\nIt emphasised that it is not \"taking away\" anyone's citizenship, adding that the CAA \"won't affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of people\".\n\nPriya Pillai, an international lawyer, said that the international community should \"keep the pressure on India\".\n\nPillai says she believes the UN High Commissioner's intervention is a signal of how seriously the issue of citizenship and potential statelessness is being taken by the international community.\n\n\"The impact on regional peace and security can also not be ruled out, especially if there is mass statelessness as a result of the law and policies being pursued\", says Pillai.","title":"Does CAA comply with India's human rights obligations?","author":["Mia Swart"],"publish_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"summary":"","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/holdstopping-stateless-challenge-india-citizenship-law-200312071917304.html","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/3/cfe9f7aa4218432b80329d458a4c29e5_18.jpg"}

Over the past six years, there have been clear political moves to fundamentally assault and redefine this Constitutional basis of both Indian nationhood and citizenship. Especially now, with the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 being passed and a not thoroughly debated all India-level NPR-National Register of Citizens (NRC) process. CJP is urging people to understand, organise and fight back democratically. Let’s stand up for the Constitution of India. We must unequivocally reject CAA 2019 and at the same time in the same breath, NPR/NRC. For this we need your support.\n\nINDIAN CITIZENSHIP:\n\nCitizenship gives us the right to have rights. Apart from voting rights, citizens are entitled to fundamental rights such as equality, freedom of speech, non-discrimination, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, etc. They have a right to permanently reside in India. Most state welfare schemes are only meant for citizens, e.g., MNREGA, reservation for SC/ ST / OBC people, food ration via the PDS, etc. Foreigners in India are only entitled to the fundamental right of life and personal liberty.\n\nIndian citizenship can be by birth, naturalisation, registration and annexation. In most of India, for citizenship by birth, from 1950-1987 a person has to be born here to be an Indian citizen; after 1987, apart from her/his birth, one of the parents has to be an Indian Citizen; after 2004, in addition to his/her birth, one of the parents has be an Indian Citizen and the other should not be an illegal migrant.\n\nDue to the Assam Accord, 1985, foreigners who had entered Assam before March 25, 1971, were to be given citizenship.\n\nPROBLEMS IN THE PROCESS OF THE NPR+NRC:\n\nThe fact that about 70% of the 19 lakh people who are out of the NRC in Assam are women shows that the method of asking people to furnish documents to prove their citizenship is incorrect at a very basic level – the NRC can only catch those who lack the required documents, not illegal immigrants. Even for rural-to-urban migration in India, the men move alone first and later try to bring women and children to the city, so it sounds impossible that there could be so many more female illegal immigrants than male ones. And now, the govt is planning to implement this disastrous NRC all over India!\n\nThe NPR is the first step of the proposed NRC (or NRIC). The NPR seems similar to the Census, but it’s not. The NPR comes under the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, while the census is conducted under the Census Act, 1948.\n\nThe process of the NPR, which leads to the NRC is as follows:\n\no For the NPR, govt employees will go to every home, collecting all the names and other details of every person living in India, whether citizen or foreigner.\n\no Then they will sit in their office, look at the information collected and decide who all seem to be “doubtful citizens”.\n\no Such “doubtful citizens” will then be asked to produce documents to prove that they are citizens.\n\no Decisions will be made about which of these “doubtful citizens” qualify to be Indian citizens.\n\no A ‘National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC)’ will be prepared.\n\no Those whose names appear in this list will be given a National Citizenship card.\n\no If you don’t have the card, you are not an Indian citizen!\n\nHighly bureaucratic and time-consuming process.\n\nTremendous power in the hands of the sarkari babus, who might be corrupt.\n\nAny person can raise objections on your inclusion in the NRC. This objection could be because of petty personal enmity, professional rivalry, discrimination due to your mother-tongue, caste, religion, etc.\n\nPrivacy of the census data is protected as per provisions of Census Act 1948. No such provision exists under NPR. The possible misuse of the data is a serious concern.\n\nPEOPLE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE NPR+NRC:\n\nWomen are the most vulnerable (more than 2/3 rd of the people out of the Assam NRC are women). Women often lack documents/ face problems of their documents not matching, because of the possibility of their:\n\nof the people out of the Assam NRC are women). Women often lack documents/ face problems of their documents not matching, because of the possibility of their: changing their names after marriage (in some communities, women even change their first names, not just surnames)\n\nnot being sent to school\n\nnot inheriting property\n\nshifting to other villages/towns after marriage.\n\nThe poor and uneducated of all communities, who lack documents.\n\nSC (approx. 23 crore Indians), ST (approx. 12 crore Indians) and OBC (approx. 55 crore Indians) who are often poor and thus might not have the required documents.\n\nNomads and Adivasis, who are often left out of the government’s documentation.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the21 crore Indian Muslims are poor, like SC/ STs. Very many of them may not have documents and they might have to face the lethal combination of CAA+NRC.\n\nOrphans and abandoned children, who might not have the required documents for themselves and their parents. There are 3.1 crore such children in India, according to the UNICEF.\n\nPeople from the LGBTQIA communities, including transgender people, who are often disowned by their families.\n\nAt least 42% (51.5 crore) of India’s population does not have a birth certificate. This includes elderly people who were born in an era when births were often not registered and people who are born at home/ rural areas where even now births are not registered.\n\nMigrant labourers.\n\nIlliterate people. For the more than 27 crore Indians who can’t read or write, it’s weird that a piece of paper can decide their destiny.\n\nDisabled people. Many of the disabled are abandoned, lack documents or have high probability of iris and thumbprint mismatch, say rights organisations. As per the 2011 census, 2.1 crore Indians are disabled, with 1.21 crore being illiterate. However, according to the World Bank, the number of disabled persons in India is much higher, between four and eight crore.\n\nPeople whose names are spelled differently in different documents, a mistake that is quite common in India, partly because of numerology. (In Assam, a man whose name was spelled as Sakhen Ali in one document and Saken Ali in another, had to spend 5 years in a detention camp.)\n\nPeople whose documents have been lost during calamities like floods or simply misplaced over the years. Some government offices’ records have been destroyed in floods and fires, or eaten by rats and termites, so it might not be possible to get duplicate copies from the government.\n\nWHY CAA IS CONSIDERED DISCRIMINATORY:\n\nCAA gives eligibility for Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians (i.e., non-Muslims) from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who reached India before 2015.\n\nCAA ignores persecuted minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar as well as Hazaras, Ahmadis, atheists and political dissenters, who face persecution in Pakistan.\n\nThis act is the first instance of religion being used as a criterion for Indian citizenship. CAA violates Constitutional secular principles and is a violation of Articles 13, 14, 15, 16 and 21 which guarantee the right to equality, equality before the law and non-discriminatory treatment by the Indian State.\n\nCAA is about illegal migrants. Citizenship via naturalisation or registration is not available to illegal migrants. There is no way for a Muslim who is declared an ‘illegal migrant’ to get citizenship in India.\n\nIndian Muslims could be badly affected by CAA+NRC, because those Muslims who do not have the documents required to prove their citizenship in a nationwide NRC could be declared as illegal migrants and they would not be able to use CAA, like non-Muslim Indians perhaps could, to get citizenship by lying and claiming that they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nPROBLEMS FOR NON-MUSLIMS TAKING CITIZENSHIP VIA CAA:\n\nThe NRC will affect people of all religions. Many non-Muslims are not worried about the NRC, because they think that if they are declared non-citizens because they don’t have the required documents, they can get citizenship via CAA by lying and saying that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They are not aware that it would not be so easy to get citizenship fraudulently via CAA. Even if a person manages to get citizenship via CAA by lying, it could mean a lifetime of insecurity. These are some of the problems which could crop up:\n\nHow can a Marathi manoos or a Malayali girl or a Tamilian man who don’t have the proper documents, and can’t speak Bengali, Urdu, Punjabi or Pashtu, claim to be from Bangladesh/ Pakistan/ Afghanistan? Some activists say that CAA 2019 – despite what the government implies – cannot or will not offer citizenship to non-Muslims who are Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati or Tamil speaking.\n\nQuestions and concerns regarding Reservations for SC/ ST/ OBC people:\n\no What would happen to Reservations for SC/ ST/ OBCs if the concerned person is out of the NRC and has to take citizenship via CAA?\n\no Would those who claim to be illegal immigrants from these 3 countries be eligible to get reservations?\n\no What is the proof that they belong to the caste that they claim to be from?\n\no If they do not have to supply even the basic proof that they actually belong to these 3 countries, what would stop say, a general category person from claiming that he is actually an illegal Dalit immigrant and thus eligible for reservations?\n\no Reservations are complex, politically charged matters. Different castes are eligible for reservations in various states and even districts of India, depending on the history and the politics of that place. The Supreme Court has ruled that a person belonging to SCs or STs in one state cannot be deemed to be a SC or ST in other states where he has migrated for the purpose of employment or education, saying that such persons would be eating away the quota meant for the native SCs or STs. E.g. Thoti is considered as a scheduled tribe only in Aurangabad, Jalna, Bid, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur, Parbhani and Hingoli districts and Rajura tehsil of Chandrapur district in Maharashtra. How would a Thoti person belonging to Rajura tehsil of Chandrapur fare if he/she has to lie and claim to be from Bangladesh?\n\no Some Bahujan activists allege that while CAA+NPR+NRC is openly anti-Muslim, the hidden agenda is to deprive poor SC/ ST/ OBC people of Reservations and disempower them.\n\nImagine your vulnerability and the power that anyone would have over you and your loved ones, including your female relatives, if you lie and say that you are an illegal immigrant.\n\nA sarkari babu, who could be corrupt, might have the power to decide whether or not you are eligible for citizenship via CAA if you do not have the required documents.\n\nHow can crores of people lie blatantly and say that they are from another country? If they are proved to be lying (as should be quite easy to do), what happens to them?\n\nIf you lie and say that you are an illegal immigrant, then all your life before the time you claim to have migrated might officially be nullified. It would, in some ways, be like you are actually a penniless refugee who is having to start life from square one.\n\nWhat happens to all your property, possessions, educational qualifications which are from before the time you say that you migrated to India?\n\nWhat happens to marriages that happened from before the time a person says that he/she migrated to India? Would the marriages be annulled? Would the children from marriages like these be considered illegitimate? What safeguards are there to prevent this from being misused?\n\nAncestral property (as opposed to self-earned property, which can be willed) can be given only to the descendants. Would you lose your ancestral property if you have to claim to be an immigrant?\n\nWhat happens to family ownership of companies, insurance, the right to inherit property which is not covered by a will, govt jobs on compassionate basis, even the right to continue staying in your parents’ rented property, etc., that come from being related to your family members if you say that you are an immigrant from any other country?\n\nIn case your child says that he/she is an immigrant from another country, how can you claim any legal rights for maintenance in your old age?\n\nWhat about a crime, like say rape, murder or even embezzlement, which has been committed before the time when the person says he/she migrated from a certain country? If the government legally accepts that the accused was not in the country when the crime occurred, how can he/she be prosecuted?\n\nIn case there is this large-scale state-sanctioned dishonesty, how much respect for the law would remain in the country?\n\nWhat if a subsequent government rolls back CAA after the NRC has been carried out? What would be the status of your citizenship and your life?\n\nWhat if the police or other officials decide to probe your claim of being an illegal immigrant, because of the state government, corruption, petty enmity or simple conscientiousness?\n\nAs a matter of self-respect, would you be okay with lying and saying that you are an illegal immigrant from another country? Would you be okay with denying that you are the child of your parents?\n\nWhy should the country be subjected to this nightmarish disruption, to this ‘cutting the nose to spite the face’?\n\nTHE FINANCIAL COST OF A NATIONWIDE NRC:\n\nThe Assam NRC cost Rs 1200 crores, over a 10-year period and employed around 52,000 people for a population of 3 crore people. It’s likely to cost more than Rs 55,000 crore just for the government to conduct the nationwide NRC for 134 crore people if we project the figures to a national level. (In comparison, the Indian government spends around Rs 65,000 crore on health and Rs 95,000 crore on education every year.)\n\nIndia’s current population is around 134 crore. If even 1% of them (1.34 crore) are declared illegal immigrants, it will cost around Rs 2 lakh crore (Rs. 22,00,00,00,00,000) to build detention centres for them.\n\nIt would cost the government thousands of crores every year to maintain these detention centres, to feed and keep imprisoned all those people who were earning a living and happily managing their homes by themselves.\n\nEvery Indian would have to pay for this in the form of direct and indirect taxes (even a packet of biscuits is taxed).\n\nThe loss of productivity of the accused and their families.\n\nThe government officials, the courts and the people who have to defend themselves and their loved ones would be spending their time in activity which does not create any usable service or good and thus be a drain on the economy.\n\nThe money which the common people will have to spend defending themselves. In Assam, which has a population of 3.2 crore people, this amount has been estimated at 11, 000 crore rupees till now and is expected to shoot through the roof as 19 lakh people have to spend for defending themselves in foreigners’ tribunals and the courts. Nationwide, just the 11,000 crore rupees can be projected to more than 5 lakh crore rupees.\n\nThe effect on the economy of the strife. So many crores of people who have not committed any crime are unlikely to meekly consent to their citizenship and rights being taken away and let business proceed as usual.\n\nPossible international economic sanctions on India. 50% of our GDP is currently from the external sector.\n\nPossible economic collapse.\n\nPOSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF CARRYING OUT CAA+NPR+NRC:\n\nThe immense suffering of crores of people.\n\nTremendous power would be concentrated in the hands of the government, right from the top to even petty sarkari clerks and police constables.\n\nCrores of people might be declared non-citizens just because they lack the required documents. They might be locked up in detention camps or allowed to continue living in India as non-citizens., deprived of all the fundamental rights and without the right to vote, get food via PDS, avail of MNREGA, etc.\n\nDisenfranchisement and dis-empowerment of the poor would result in governments being elected which would not have to bother about the interests of the poor. Amartya Sen won a Noble Prize for his theory that famines can never occur in democratic societies. Elected governments are attuned to the common people’s needs, because they have the strength to vote them out of power. So, at the time of drought, these govts take steps to prevent a famine.\n\nIndia has one of the highest rates of economic inequality in the whole world, with the wealth of India’s top 9 billionaires being equal to the wealth of the bottom 50% population. The NRC process which would disproportionately affect the poor, would make the Indian poor even poorer.\n\nIf non-citizens are not given free treatment in government hospitals and clinics, this would increase the incidence and spread of contagious diseases in the general population.\n\nCollapse of the economy.\n\nThe courts which are overburdened even now, would be swamped with cases, since the crores of people who are deemed illegal immigrants by the quasi-judicial Foreigners Tribunals would be able to file cases in High Courts and even appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIncrease in crime and a lack of respect for the law.\n\nLike the poem goes, apathy to other communities’ victimisation can lead to lack of support when it’s your turn to be victimised: “First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist./ Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew./ Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”\n\nPossibility of large-scale infiltration into India from neighbouring countries due to CAA leading to a security threat.\n\nIncrease in riots, terror attacks.\n\nSome people have compared these laws to the Nuremberg laws passed in Germany in 1935 which stripped Jews of their citizenship and warned that CAA+NPR+NRC could lead to a genocide similar to the Holocaust in which Jews were vilified, stripped of their citizenship, then taken away to concentration camps and finally killed in gas chambers. 6 million Jews were systematically murdered by the Nazis. When the Nazis staged pogroms against the Jews, Golwalkar, the then head of the RSS, called it the highest form of “race pride.” He praised Nazi Germany for “purging the country” of Jews. He called the Nazi racial policies — the Nuremberg Laws — “a good lesson for us to learn and profit by.” Golwalkar said that any Indian who is not a Hindu is a “traitor” and called it “treason” to be a non-Hindu in India. Modi calls Golwalkar his “guru worthy of worship”.\n\nPossibility of civil war.\n\nContempt in the world community for India.\n\nNegative effect on non-resident Indians all over the world.\n\nNegative effect on the Hindus who live in neighbouring countries.\n\nHostility, unhappiness and ill-will in society. Emotions are contagious, guilt tears into people and no man is an island.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO STOP CAA+NPR+NRC:\n\nRaise awareness about the issue amongst your family, friends, co-workers and neighbours. Convince them that CAA+NPR+NRC has the potential to be disastrous for us and should be stopped.\n\nProtest – don’t be silent & don’t be violent. There are groups of people protesting non-violently in various ways all over India and even internationally. Join them.\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, Telegram, YouTube and even TikTok have given all of us the power to raise our voices. Use social media against this disastrous plan. We can also use emails, smses, phone calls, blogs, online petitions, etc.\n\nVolunteer and contribute, in whichever way that you can, to groups and organisations which are working against CAA+NPR+NRC.\n\nFollow the call regarding non-cooperation with the process of the NPR if and when it is given by the groups agitating against CAA+NPR+NRC.\n\nContribute to the movement through your work, especially if you are a media-person, lawyer, politician, filmmaker, influencer, artist, social worker, etc.\n\nRight now, the fight against CAA+NPR+NRC is extremely urgent and important. Long-term, we have to work at transforming people and spreading the ideas of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity.\n\nConvince your state governments to pass resolutions against CAA, NPR and NRC in their assemblies and to file cases in the Supreme Court. The state government’s machinery is required to carry out the NPR. If the non-BJP states, which cover 57 % of the Indian population, do not implement the NPR, the nationwide NRC would become meaningless.\n\nWe, the people of India, successfully fought for independence against the mighty British Empire and we gave ourselves the Indian Constitution which is based on the values of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity. We will successfully fight against CAA+NPR+NRC using Gandhiji’s non-violent methods and protect our beloved Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution.\n\nThis article has been written by a group of activists, distilling material from articles published in various periodicals and CJP’s pamphlets.
