       "India and China, two nuclear-armed Asian neighbours, are in a tense diplomatic and military standoff following their first deadly border clash in more than 40 years.\\n\\nThe June 15 incident in the disputed Galwan Valley, an arid Himalayan area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between the two nations, left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China has yet to officially declare its casualties.\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nIndian and Chinese troops have been engaged in the standoff since early May at several points along the 3,500km (2,200-mile) LAC, most of which remains undemarcated.\\n\\nThe heightened tensions between the world's two most populous countries have drawn international concerns, with the United Nations urging both sides \"to exercise maximum restraint\".\\n\\nHere are five things you need to know about the dispute:\\n\\nWhat happened on June 15?\\n\\nThe fighting on June 15 was triggered by a disagreement over two Chinese tents and observation towers that Indian officials said had been built on its side of the LAC.\\n\\nChinese troops breached the Line to set up temporary \"structures\" in the Galwan Valley even after military officials had reached an agreement on June 6 to de-escalate, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told China's senior diplomat, Wang Yi, in a phone call.\\n\\nThe problem arose when an Indian patrol visited the area near a ridge to verify a Chinese assertion that its troops had moved back from the LAC, two government sources told Reuters news agency.\\n\\nThe Chinese troops had thinned out, leaving behind two tents and small observation posts, which the Indian party demolished, the sources said.\\n\\nA large group of Chinese soldiers arrived and confronted the Indian troops. It was not clear what happened next, but the two sides soon clashed, the Chinese soldiers reportedly using iron rods and batons with spikes, killing 20 Indian soldiers and wounding dozens of others.\\n\\nChina has not said anything about any losses in the hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\nOn Sunday, V K Singh, Indian federal minister for roads and transport and a former army chief, claimed China lost at least 40 soldiers in the clash, without providing any evidence.\\n\\nChina's state-controlled Global Times said there had been Chinese casualties, but did not elaborate.\\n\\nIndian army convoy moves along the Srinagar-Leh National highway towards Ladakh [Faisal Khan/Anadolu]\\n\\nWhy did the clash happen?\\n\\nExperts mainly cite two reasons for the deadliest clash since 1975.\\n\\nA major reason, according to some experts, is linked to India's unilateral move last year to repeal Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which had guaranteed a measure of autonomy to the former Jammu and Kashmir state, which also included the disputed areas in Ladakh region.\\n\\nChina, which, like Pakistan, saw India's move as unilaterally affecting its territory, strongly denounced the move at the UN Security Council last year.\\n\\nAnalysts also believe the current standoff is also a result of China's pushback against India's recent construction of infrastructure in border areas.\\n\\nIndia inaugurated the 255km (158-mile) Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road, built along the LAC, last year. China objected, seeing the move as a threat to its interests in the region.\\n\\nChina's economic corridor to Pakistan and Central Asia passes through Karakoram, which is close to Galwan Valley, the site of the June 15 clash. Galwan Valley is close to Aksai Chin Plateau, which is under Chinese control but claimed by India.\\n\\nAccording to Happymon Jacob, professor of international relations at New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University, China considers the Ladakh region crucial for its \"access to Central Asia and CPEC project with Pakistan in which they [China] have invested billions of dollars [about $60bn].\"\\n\\nIndian Border Security Force soldiers guard a highway leading towards Leh, bordering China, in Gagangir [Tauseef Mustafa/AFP]\\n\\nWhat is each side claiming?\\n\\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he was unaware of the specifics but that the Indian army had crossed into Chinese territory in several places in recent days - violating the agreement reached on June 6 - and that they should withdraw.\\n\\nCalling it a \"deliberate provocation\" on New Delhi's part, Zhao said: \"The rights and wrongs... are very clear and the responsibility rests entirely with the Indian side.\"\\n\\nIn response, India's foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava cautioned China against making \"exaggerated and untenable claims\" on the sovereignty of the Galwan Valley area.\\n\\nIndia says China occupies 38,000 sq km (15,000 square miles) of its territory in the Aksai Chin Plateau in the Himalayas, with 12,000 Chinese soldiers reportedly pushing across the border.\\n\\nLast week, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi categorically refuted claims of China's takeover of any Indian territory - his statement contrasting with the government's earlier claims.\\n\\nModi's denial of a Chinese incursion triggered a controversy, with opposition leaders accusing the government of intelligence failures and asking why the clash happened in the first place.\\n\\n\"Modiâ€™s remarks will be very helpful to ease the tensions because as the Prime Minister of India, he has removed the moral basis for hardliners to further accuse China\" : Global Times https://t.co/2jOOuR53M1 â€” Suhasini Haidar (@suhasinih) June 22, 2020\\n\\nWho holds the advantage?\\n\\nAshley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes the latest Chinese advances in the Ladakh region leaves India with \"painful\" choices.\\n\\n\"Beijing has moved into disputed territories that did not host a continual Chinese presence as recently as January 2020,\" Tellis wrote on June 4, days before the brawl.\\n\\nSatellite pictures taken by Earth-imaging company, Planet Labs, in the days leading up to the clash, also suggest increased Chinese activity at the Galwan Valley.\\n\\n\"Looking at it in Planet, it looks like China is constructing roads in the valley and possibly damming the river,\" Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told Reuters.\\n\\n\"There are a tonne of vehicles on both sides [of the LAC] - although there appear to be vastly more on the Chinese side. I count 30-40 Indian vehicles and well over 100 vehicles on the Chinese side.\"\\n\\nIn addition to its dispute with China, India has found itself at loggerheads with two other neighbours - long-standing rival Pakistan, and Nepal.\\n\\nNepal and India have historically enjoyed good ties, but now find themselves engaged in what experts have called a cartographic war over border regions.\\n\\nLast week, Nepal's Parliament approved a new map for the country, which includes land controlled by India.\\n\\n\"On the one hand, the major power in the region, China, is against India and on the other hand, smaller neighbours, which have been traditionally very friendly to India, are also negatively disposed to India. I think that is a major policy failure,\" Jacob told Al Jazeera.\\n\\nWhat now?\\n\\nThe reaction in India to Chinese advances has been one of outrage, with citizens and trade associations calling for the Modi-led government to boycott Chinese goods.\\n\\nProtesters across the country were seen burning Chinese flags and products, while videos on social media showed teenagers destroying their Chinese-made mobile phones.\\n\\nBeijing is India's biggest trading partner, with annual bilateral trade worth $92bn. The trade imbalance between the two is significant, and favours China heavily.\\n\\nIn an interview to The Economic Times, Shyam Saran, former Indian foreign secretary, said India should avoid any \"knee-jerk reactions\" against China, claiming that it would be impossible for New Delhi to find alternative suppliers in the near future.\\n\\nJacob believes India should reach out to Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as Quad - an informal strategic forum that includes India, Japan, Australia and the United States - to take on China.\\n\\n\"If the USA makes noises in favour of India and strengthens the Quad, it will send a message to China that we will take aggressive steps and will defend our interest,\" he said.\\n\\nA trilateral summit between India, China and Russia is scheduled on Tuesday. The virtual meeting, to be attended by India's foreign minister, is likely to address the border standoff.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Indian and Chinese armies are also talking on the LAC to defuse the tensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3\n",
       "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday paid a surprise visit to Leh and Ladakh for the first time after the clash with China in the region. PM Modi also addressed the soldiers at Ladakh praising their 'fire and fury' and paid tributes to the ones martyred in the Galwan Valley clash. Earlier, India and China agreed to disengage and \"strictly abide\" by the important consensus reached by their leaders and a series of agreements.

       "Twenty Indian soldiers were killed by Chinese troops late Monday in a clash along the disputed India-China border, the first such episode in decades, military experts said. The violence is a continuation of a decades-old dispute between the two nuclear powers over the precise location of their Himalayan border.\\n\\nWhat is the â€˜Line of Actual Controlâ€™ and why does it matter?\\n\\nSix decades ago, India and China went to war over a border dispute that ended with an uneasy truce in 1962.\\n\\nWhile no border has ever officially been negotiated along the forbidding stretch of land high in the Himalayas that divides the two nations, the truce established a 2,100-mile-long Line of Actual Control.\\n\\nSince then, an uneasy peace has held.

       "If you have been following Chinaâ€™s military activities along its borders with India in recent years, you will not look up to Donald Trumpâ€™s White House to notice the Chinese â€œpattern of aggressionâ€�. THE writing has always been on THE WALL except that we tend to fret over rather than learn from it and be prepared. In brief, even Galwan 2020 â€“ an outright brutal incident in which 20 Indian soldiers died â€“ is far from being the last such incident and farther from being the worst in current generationâ€™s memory.\\n\\nChina traditionally inflamed a border row with India to achieve two sets of objective: first geopolitical and second military, in declining order of priority. Almost all the key border incidents bear the stamp of Beijingâ€™s wider objective to play a leading role on the world stage â€“ whenever necessary, at the cost of India. The military aspect aims at testing Indiaâ€™s preparedness and response, and thereby keep New Delhi under pressure. Under President Xi Jinping, these traditional objectives have attained a more nationalist strain â€“ a reflection of the Chinese leaderâ€™s aggressive domestic and foreign posturing and policies from Xinjiang to Hong Kong and from the South China Sea to the Indo-Pacific.\\n\\nAt the outset, let us concede that it takes Chinese belligerence and gall to enter the territory of possibly your most potent and a sensitive neighbour â€“ India â€“ and then blame the same country of changing the status quo along the border while altering it itself all along. The irony is that the Chinese have always stuck to such a pattern â€“ the testimony being the increasing number of border transgressions over the last decade. At last count, it was 663 in 2019. As it appears, New Delhi has been naive to underestimate Chinese intransigence. Now letâ€™s test how China under Xi has been strongly pushing the two-pronged goals via border flare-ups.\\n\\nThe first lessons could be deciphered from the set of events around the 16-day Chumar and Demchok incident in September 2014 and nearly three-week-long Depsang Plain standoff in April 2013 â€“ both in eastern Ladakh. Before that, the last such major incident happened in late January 2000 in Aksai China area of Ladakh on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) just after the 17th Karmapa escaped to Dharamshala in early January that year.\\n\\nThe Depsang incident beginning mid-April 2013 preceded Li Keqiangâ€™s first foreign visit as Chinese premier to India from 19-22 May. It was termed â€œnon-threateningâ€� by some experts for all that the widely reported incident meant in terms of deployment from the Chinese side were five tents, seven men and a dog. Others noted the Chinese troops in the area being about a platoon in strength. Nonetheless, Indiaâ€™s military and political deference to Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€™s (PLA) non-threatening â€œdog-tour transgressionâ€� 19KM inside India-claimed territory meant that Liâ€™s trip was not totally derailed. However, just months after Xi Jinpingâ€™s assuming office, Beijing signalled a fresh round of Chinese hardball tactics to deter Indian military and border infrastructure build-up, particularly in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector. The upcoming visit of then Indian PM Manmohan Singh from 27-29 May could not have just been a coincidence.\\n\\nThe 2014 standoff ensued on 16 September after the Chinese army began extending a road from Chepzi to Chumar (Demchok is in Chumar area). It was the eve of Xiâ€™s first visit to India and a week before the Indian PM Narendra Modi was to head for a weeklong trip to the US. A fortnight ago, Modi had concluded a high decibel visit to Japan â€“ arguably his first beyond South Asia as PM â€“ and asserted about some countries adopting the â€œexpansionistâ€� ideas of the 18th century. Days later, along the border with China, it was very much a threatening stand-off with nearly 1,500 Indian and 750 Chinese soldiers standing face-to-face. The emphasis put by Modi on the boundary question took a major slice out of the investment cake Xi may have planned to offer a meeker India.\\n\\nIf anything, since then, India clearly has been more persistent if not outright assertive in holding its ground. China, however, appears to have become more determined than ever before to keep New Delhi at its place. In 2016, India pursued a vigorous campaign to gain a seat in the nuclear cartel â€“ Nuclear Suppliers Group. China continues to block it on various grounds.\\n\\nIn mid-May 2017, India rejected Chinaâ€™s invitation to attend Xiâ€™s showcase Belt and Road Initiativeâ€™s first summit in Beijing. In spite of Chinese insistence that BRI was a purely economic initiative, India termed it a grand strategy to tighten Beijingâ€™s geopolitical heft. The key Indian objection remains to the BRIâ€™s flagship China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which passes through India-claimed Pak-Occupied Kashmir.\\n\\nJust one month later, around mid-June 2017, the Chinese troops began laying a road in the Doka La area of Doklam plateau â€“ a Bhutanese territory north of the Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet trijunction â€“ leading to a 73-day standoff. After several rounds of tough talks and military build-ups, the climb down began just a week before the annual Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) summit in the Chinese city of Xiamen in early September 2017. Beijing acquiesced since Indiaâ€™s boycott of BRICS â€“ an emerging China-dominated grouping â€“ would have curtailed its global standing. However, not long after Wuhan and Mamallapuram informal summits, we are back to square one.\\n\\nIn short, Chinaâ€™s border adventures are far more than a pattern of aggression. They are aimed to fulfil wider strategic goals and unfortunately, as the pieces of evidence point out, with the fundamental underpinning that India and China may not be rivals, but they are not friends. India would do well to keep its powders dry â€“ economically, militarily and technologically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",

(Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi) An Army convoy moves along the Srinagar-Leh highway leading to Ladakh, at Gagingir in Ganderbal district, on June 17, 2020. (Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi)\\n\\nThe stand-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh is now in its ninth week. A conversation between the two foreign ministers, three rounds of Corps Commander-level talks, other discussions at the diplomatic and military levels have failed to break the impasse. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the â€œenemies of India have seen the fire and fury of our forcesâ€�, and warned that â€œIndiaâ€™s commitment to peace should not be seen as its weaknessâ€�.\\n\\nWhat options are available to India to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the region?\\n\\nOPTION 1: Evict the Chinese by force, destroy what they built\\n\\nThe most straightforward course of action would be for Indian soldiers to push out the Chinese from the new areas that they have occupied in the last eight weeks, and destroy all the infrastructure China has built on the Indian side of the LAC.\\n\\nThis, however, will almost certainly lead to military escalation and in a full-blown war. Even the limited attempt to evict the Chinese from the observation post near PP14 on June 15 led to the clash in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese lost their lives.\\n\\nIn the areas where the Chinese have come over to the Indian side of the LAC, the Indian Army may not be well disposed, due to constraints of terrain or infrastructure, to execute such a precisely targeted operation successfully. Also, some of the areas that the Chinese have entered are claimed by both countries, with no agreement over the alignment of the LAC. This will make it difficult for New Delhi to garner international support for its move.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Unlikely.\\n\\nAlso from Explained | Tokyo 2014 to Ladakh 2020: PM Modiâ€™s full circle to draw line for Beijing\\n\\nA map of the Ladakh region. (Express) A map of the Ladakh region. (Express)\\n\\nOPTION 2: â€˜Quid pro quoâ€™ tactic\\n\\nThere are areas on the LAC that are not strongly defended by the Chinese, where Indian soldiers can move in and occupy a swathe of Chinese territory. At the negotiating table, the two sides can then exchange the occupied territories, and restore status quo ante. This option has been discussed at the highest levels â€” most noticeably in the 2012 policy document â€˜Non-alignment 2.0â€™ â€” and is believed to have also been war-gamed by the military. According to strategic affairs analyst Ashley Tellis, the 2013 Chinese incursion in Depsang was reversed within three weeks after the Indian Army moved to the Chinese side in Chumar, and did some construction of their own. In the negotiations that followed, the two sides agreed to return to their earlier positions.\\n\\nThe â€˜QPQâ€™ option exists even now, as the entire LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh cannot be physically defended by the Chinese army. But such proactive options have a certain window of opportunity, which may have been lost after eight weeks of tensions. Also, it carries the risk of military escalation, as the Chinese may misread it as a larger military attack, or see it as a provocation.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Unlikely, but possible.\\n\\nAlso read | India should avoid strategic miscalculation: China on LAC standoff\\n\\nOPTION 3: Hold the line and negotiate\\n\\nIn this scenario, the Indian Army â€œholds the lineâ€� by deploying in strength along the LAC to ensure that the Chinese do not ingress deeper. This stops the Chinese at their current positions, while preparing Indian defences and allowing for a buildup of troops for any eventuality that may arise. The forces also get time to build up arsenal and stocks through import of critical material.\\n\\nTalks are held simultaneously, including, if required, at the highest political level, to ensure the Chinese side returns to status quo ante. These are backed up by non-military moves against the Chinese, in the economic and trade domains, as has been witnessed recently. It allows New Delhi to demonstrate its resolve to the Chinese, while signalling to the world that it is a responsible power that would not be reckless.\\n\\nðŸ“£ Express Explained is now on Telegram.

It could allow for the formation of newer diplomatic, security, and trade partnerships to put China under pressure.\\n\\nThe downside is the prolongation of the standoff, possibly into winter, which would impose a heavy logistic and financial burden on the Indian Army. It also carries the risk of an accidental escalation, in case of an incident between soldiers on two sides who are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball in an environment of high tension for a long time. And the biggest risk is that the Chinese may not actually concede anything on the ground even as Indians continue to hold the line â€” the continued Chinese deployment and new constructions could alter the status quo permanently.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Most likely.\\n\\nOPTION 4: A limited war\\n\\nIt can be limited in terms of geography â€” say, only in Ladakh, or in time â€” for a few days before India unilaterally declares a cessation of hostilities. This would be a very bold move; it carries the greatest risk of a full-blown war against a well-prepared adversary. Also, China has integrated theatre commands, where the full Sino-Indian border is seen as a single front under their western theatre command. It may not keep the war limited to the areas India would want it to, and stretch the Indian military fully.\\n\\nThis option also needs a heavy commitment of military resources, which will impact Indiaâ€™s post-Covid economic revival. There will be no global appetite to take sides, and Pakistan could simultaneously open another front. The only advantage is of sending China a strong message â€” because a bigger power, in this case China, has to win unequivocally, whereas not getting defeated can in itself be seen as a win for India.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Highly unlikely.\\n\\nðŸ“£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

What remains to be seen is the impact that the tragic loss of lives will have on the future trajectory of the broader India-China relationship, how the ramifications will play out on the regional chessboard, and to what extent the rules of engagement at the LAC, which had been arduously worked out over years, would be diluted or transformed.â€�\\n\\nThe flare-up has forced the Centre to bump up its security measures along its borders, with the Indian Air Force beefing up its bases along the LAC in case the situation escalates.\\n\\nâ€œIt is unclear whether such aggression is meant to be a Chinese show of strength and intent in response to the international criticism and calls for accountability by several prominent members of the international community for its role in the origination and spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), or an effort to divert the attention of its growing number of disenchanted subjects struggling to cope with the steep economic downturn and uncertainty, or even opportunism in making the most of a weakened and inattentive United States (US) that is grappling with a severe COVID-19 outbreak and a divisive election campaign. What is, however, not at all ambiguous is that China has been testing the limits of international laws, conventions and norms, and the attack on the LAC was the latest and most serious manifestation,â€� the report claimed.\\n\\nThe body observed that the LAC attack led to Chinaâ€™s most serious security situation with India in recent years, and flared emotions have meant that the potential for rapid escalation is rife.\\n\\nâ€œAlthough experts seem unclear on what prompted China to believe that such volatility, which was the obvious outcome that could be anticipated from an attack such as the one that it launched at the LAC, would be in its interests, most seem to concur that the Chinese attack marks the 21st century turning point for India and China, and that the two countries face a future characterized by deepened distrust and potential fresh conflict,â€� they said.\\n\\nThe EFSAS further elaborated on Chinaâ€™s nefarious tactics to usurp territories in the South China Sea even after a global outcry over the strategic misadventure.\\n\\nâ€œThe attack on Indian troops comes on the back of an increasing Chinese assertiveness, be it in the South China Sea, Taiwan or Hong Kong. China has been flexing its muscle across the region, intercepting Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea, seizing new powers over Hong Kong and twice sailing an aircraft carrier through the sensitive Taiwan Strait,â€� the think tank said.\\n\\nThe Ministry of External Affairs on Saturday stated that Chinaâ€™s â€œuntenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control are not acceptableâ€� in wake of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijianâ€™s false claims earlier in the day that Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh is located on the Chinese side of the border. â€œWe expect that the Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the Foreign Ministers,â€� MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "LAC Border News: India & China got engaged into a violent face off on 15th June night when the troops of both the armies fired at each other in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh. Both the nations suffered several casualties. Indian Army lost around 20 of its soldiers. Though Indian & Chinese armies got disengaged on 16th June, it is anticipated that the tensions between India and China may grow over the disagreements over the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. China has been continuously building up its military presence along the LAC by deploying its armed forces and artillery guns. The areas where China is growing its military presence are close to the territory of India from where China can reach Indian locations in a few hours. In this article, we have shared below what is LAC, where is it located on Map, why it is a disputed area between India & China and what is the difference between LOC and LAC.\\n\\nWhy the LAC is in News?\\n\\nThe locals of eastern Ladakh have reported the movement of hundreds of army vehicles along the LAC over the past few weeks. These vehicles are parked just 25 to 30 KM away from Indian side of the LAC. The troop movement of Chinese military comes at a time when both the countries are in a stand-off along the Line of Actual Control at Pangong Tso and the Galwan river valley. As of now, the Indian and Chinese armies are in talks to address the issue of LAC and sort the differences over the border area in eastern Ladakh.\\n\\nEarlier on May 4-5, 2020, Indian Army and Chinese Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) were seen in a face-off near near Pangong Tso, Ladakh, around 170 km from Leh. Additionally, the Chinese PLA troops completed the construction of a 3 km long road on the north bank of Pangong Tso lake from Finger 5 to Finger 8.\\n\\nWhy China's construction of road near Pangong Tso is a matter of concern?\\n\\nThe Chinese army has just winded up with the extension of road near Pangong Tso lake in just a period of two weeks in the similar manner when it extended the road over LAC to Tawang in October 1962 in just two weeks after capturing the border.\\n\\nWhat is the status of Indian Army at the LAC?\\n\\nThe Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road is strategically important for India. In order to contain the threat from Ladakh's Galwan valley, Indian troops have been positioned to block further movement of China's PLA toward India. However, there is no deployment of any Indian Tanks.\\n\\nWhat is LAC & its full form?\\n\\nThe LAC stands for Line of Actual Control (LAC). It is the border demarcation line that separates the territories controlled by India & China.\\n\\nWhere is the LAC located?\\n\\nThe LAC is located in three difference sectors:\\n\\nEastern sector: Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim\\n\\nMiddle sector: Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh\\n\\nWestern sector: Ladakh\\n\\nWhy LAC is a disputed area between India & China?\\n\\nFor India, the LAC is 3,488 km long, however for China, it is just 2,000 km long. India has been building its territory over the LAC considering its 3488 km length. China has been demanding a freeze on such construction activities and infrastructural development by India. The major disagreements between India and China are over the LAC at the Eastern (Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim) & Western sectors (Ladakh). There is no clarification on the LAC boundary.\\n\\nAgreements on LAC between India & China\\n\\nChina and India have signed four agreements on this boundary issue. These agreements were signed in September 1993, November 1996, April 2005 and October 2013. Indian & Chinese bilateral talks on border disputes is held on the basis of these four agreements. However, these agreements are considered to be flawed and are unable to resolve the boundary issue between the countries. Have a look at the details of these four agreements:\\n\\nYear Agreement Flaw September 1993 Maintenance of peace & tranquility along LAC No activities of China and India will overstep the LAC These agreements are away from ground reality. There is no mention of the actual line location.

(AP Photo: Channi Anand, File)\\n\\nAs tensions continue between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a look at what the line means on the ground and the disagreements over it:\\n\\nWhat is the Line of Actual Control?\\n\\nThe LAC is the demarcation that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory. India considers the LAC to be 3,488 km long, while the Chinese consider it to be only around 2,000 km. It is divided into three sectors: the eastern sector which spans Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the middle sector in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and the western sector in Ladakh.\\n\\nWhat is the disagreement?\\n\\nThe alignment of the LAC in the eastern sector is along the 1914 McMahon Line, and there are minor disputes about the positions on the ground as per the principle of the high Himalayan watershed. This pertains to Indiaâ€™s international boundary as well, but for certain areas such as Longju and Asaphila. The line in the middle sector is the least controversial but for the precise alignment to be followed in the Barahoti plains.\\n\\nAlso read | India-China Galwan faceoff: How serious is the situation, what happens next?\\n\\nThe major disagreements are in the western sector where the LAC emerged from two letters written by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai to PM Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959, after he had first mentioned such a â€˜lineâ€™ in 1956. In his letter, Zhou said the LAC consisted of â€œthe so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the westâ€�. Shivshankar Menon has explained in his book Choices: Inside the Making of Indiaâ€™s Foreign Policy that the LAC was â€œdescribed only in general terms on maps not to scaleâ€� by the Chinese.\\n\\nAfter the 1962 War, the Chinese claimed they had withdrawn to 20 km behind the LAC of November 1959. Zhou clarified the LAC again after the war in another letter to Nehru: â€œTo put it concretely, in the eastern sector it coincides in the main with the so-called McMahon Line, and in the western and middle sectors it coincides in the main with the traditional customary line which has consistently been pointed out by Chinaâ€�. During the Doklam crisis in 2017, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged India to abide by the â€œ1959 LACâ€�.\\n\\nIndian soldiers near the Line of Actual Control at Chushul, 59 kilometers from Pangong lake in Leh.

(Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi)\\n\\nWhat was Indiaâ€™s response to Chinaâ€™s designation of the LAC?\\n\\nIndia rejected the concept of LAC in both 1959 and 1962. Even during the war, Nehru was unequivocal: â€œThere is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometres from what they call â€˜line of actual controlâ€™. What is this â€˜line of controlâ€™? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September?â€�\\n\\nIndiaâ€™s objection, as described by Menon, was that the Chinese line â€œwas a disconnected series of points on a map that could be joined up in many ways; the line should omit gains from aggression in 1962 and therefore should be based on the actual position on September 8, 1962 before the Chinese attack; and the vagueness of the Chinese definition left it open for China to continue its creeping attempt to change facts on the ground by military forceâ€�.\\n\\nRead | India-China border faceoff: Major Generals hold talks on ground, all forces put on high state of alert\\n\\nWhen did India accept the LAC?\\n\\nShyam Saran has disclosed in his book How India Sees the World that the LAC was discussed during Chinese Premier Li Pengâ€™s 1991 visit to India, where PM P V Narasimha Rao and Li reached an understanding to maintain peace and tranquillity at the LAC. India formally accepted the concept of the LAC when Rao paid a return visit to Beijing in 1993 and the two sides signed the Agreement to Maintain Peace and Tranquillity at the LAC. The reference to the LAC was unqualified to make it clear that it was not referring to the LAC of 1959 or 1962 but to the LAC at the time when the agreement was signed. To reconcile the differences about some areas, the two countries agreed that the Joint Working Group on the border issue would take up the task of clarifying the alignment of the LAC.\\n\\nWhy did India change its stance on the Line of Actual Control?\\n\\nAs per Menon, it was needed because Indian and Chinese patrols were coming in more frequent contact during the mid-1980s, after the government formed a China Study Group in 1976 which revised the patrolling limits, rules of engagement and pattern of Indian presence along the border.\\n\\nIn the backdrop of the Sumdorongchu standoff, when PM Rajiv Gandhi visited Beijing in 1988, Menon notes that the two sides agreed to negotiate a border settlement, and pending that, they would maintain peace and tranquillity along the border.\\n\\nHave India and China exchanged their maps of the LAC?\\n\\nOnly for the middle sector. Maps were â€œsharedâ€� for the western sector but never formally exchanged, and the process of clarifying the LAC has effectively stalled since 2002. As an aside, there is no publicly available map depicting Indiaâ€™s version of the LAC.\\n\\nDuring his visit to China in May 2015, PM Narendra Modiâ€™s proposal to clarify the LAC was rejected by the Chinese. Deputy Director General of the Asian Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Huang Xilian later told Indian journalists that â€œWe tried to clarify some years ago but it encountered some difficulties, which led to even complex situation. That is why whatever we do we should make it more conducive to peace and tranquillity for making things easier and not to make them complicated.â€�\\n\\nIs the LAC also the claim line for both countries?\\n\\nNot for India. Indiaâ€™s claim line is the line seen in the official boundary marked on the maps as released by the Survey of India, including both Aksai Chin and Gilgit-Baltistan. In Chinaâ€™s case, it corresponds mostly to its claim line, but in the eastern sector, it claims entire Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet. However, the claim lines come into question when a discussion on the final international boundaries takes place, and not when the conversation is about a working border, say the LAC.\\n\\nAn Army convoy moves along a Srinagar-Leh highway leading to Ladakh, at Gagingir in Ganderbal district. (Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi) An Army convoy moves along a Srinagar-Leh highway leading to Ladakh, at Gagingir in Ganderbal district. (Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi)\\n\\nBut why are these claim lines controversial in Ladakh?\\n\\nIndependent India was transferred the treaties from the British, and while the Shimla Agreement on the McMahon Line was signed by British India, Aksai Chin in Ladakh province of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was not part of British India, although it was a part of the British Empire. Thus, the eastern boundary was well defined in 1914 but in the west in Ladakh, it was not.\\n\\nA G Noorani writes in India-China Boundary Problem 1846-1947 that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patelâ€™s Ministry of States published two White Papers on Indian states. The first, in July 1948, had two maps: one had no boundary shown in the western sector, only a partial colour wash; the second one extended the colour wash in yellow to the entire state of J&K, but mentioned â€œboundary undefinedâ€�. The second White Paper was published in February 1950 after India became a Republic, where the map again had boundaries which were undefined.\\n\\nIn July 1954, Nehru issued a directive that â€œall our old maps dealing with this frontier should be carefully examined and, where necessary, withdrawn. New maps should be printed showing our Northern and North Eastern frontier without any reference to any â€˜lineâ€™. The new maps should also be sent to our embassies abroad and should be introduced to the public generally and be used in our schools, colleges, etcâ€�. This map, as is officially used till date, formed the basis of dealings with China, eventually leading to the 1962 War.\\n\\nðŸ“£ Express Explained is now on Telegram.

It was designated as the LoC in 1972, following the Shimla Agreement between the two countries. It is delineated on a map signed by DGMOs of both armies and has the international sanctity of a legal agreement. The LAC, in contrast, is only a concept â€“ it is not agreed upon by the two countries, neither delineated on a map or demarcated on the ground.\\n\\nðŸ“£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The meeting went on for 11 hours.\\n\\n\"There was a mutual consensus to disengage. Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both the sides,\" said a source.\\n\\nThe meeting had begun at around 11:30 am on Monday at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Chushul sector in eastern Ladakh.\\n\\nDuring the talks, India had yesterday strongly raised with China the \"premediated\" attack on Indian troops in Galwan Valley on June 15 and sought immediate withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers from all friction points in eastern Ladakh.\\n\\nThe first round of the Lt Gen-level talks had taken place at the same place on June 6 during which both the sides had reached an agreement to disengage eventually from all standoff points starting with Galwan Valley.\\n\\nHowever, the situation worsened following the June 15 violent clash in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian Army personnel martyred.\\n\\nAlbeit China has not yet made its casualty figure public, yet reports suggest that a commanding officer of the Chinese

       "2020 Chinaâ€“India border standoff\\n\\nThe 2020 Chinaâ€“India skirmishes are part of an ongoing military standoff between China and India. Since 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops have reportedly engaged in aggressive melee, face-offs and skirmishes at locations along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes are ongoing at locations in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has persisted since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.\\n\\nIn late May, Chinese forces objected to Indian road construction in the Galwan River valley.[21][22] According to Indian sources, melee fighting on 15/16 June 2020 resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers (including an officer)[23] and 43 Chinese soldiers (including an officer).[b][25][17][26] Several news outlets stated that 10 Indian soldiers, including 4 officers, were taken captive and then released by the Chinese on 18 June.[10] An unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were also captured and later released by India.[18]\\n\\nAmid the standoff, India reinforced the region with 12,000 additional workers, who would assist India's Border Roads Organisation in completing the development of Indian infrastructure along the Sino-Indian border.[27][28][29] Experts have postulated that the standoffs are Chinese pre-emptive measures in responding to the Darbukâ€“Shyokâ€“DBO Road infrastructure project in Ladakh.[30] The Chinese have also extensively developed their infrastructure in these disputed border regions.[31][32] Another reason is China's territory grabbing technique, also referred to as 'salami slicing', which involves encroaching upon small parts of enemy territory over a large period of time.[33][34] The revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, in August 2019, by the Indian government has also troubled the Chinese.[35] However, India and China have both maintained that there are enough bilateral mechanisms to resolve the situation through quiet diplomacy.[36][37]\\n\\nFollowing the Galwan Valley skirmish on 15 June, numerous Indian government officials said that border tensions will not impact trade between India and China despite some Indian campaigns about boycotting Chinese products.[38][39] However, in the following days, various types of action were taken on the economic front including cancellation and additional scrutiny of certain contracts with Chinese firms, and calls were also made to stop the entry of the Chinese into strategic markets in India such as the telecom sector.[40][41][42]\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe border between China and India is disputed at multiple locations. There is \"no publicly available map depicting the Indian version of the LAC,\" and the Survey of India maps are the only evidence of the official border for India.[43] The Chinese version of the LAC mostly consists of claims in the Ladakh region, but China also claims Arunachal Pradesh in northeast India.[43]\\n\\nSince the 1980s, there have been over 20 rounds of talks between the two countries related to these border issues.[44] A study by the Observer Research Foundation found that only 1 to 2 percent of border incidents between 2010 and 2014 had received any form of media coverage.[44][45] In 2019, India reported over 660 LAC violations and 108 aerial violations by the People's Liberation Army which were significantly higher than the number of incidents in 2018.[46] Despite the disputes, skirmishes, and standoffs, no incidence of gunshots being fired has been reported between the two countries along the border for over 50 years.[47]\\n\\nDuring Xi Jinping's[7] visit to New Delhi in September 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the boundary question and urged his counterpart for a solution.[48] However, in 2017, China and India got into a major standoff in Doklam that lasted 73 days.[49][50] China has since increased its military presence in the Tibetan Plateau;[51] and also stationed fighter jets at the Ngari Gunsa Airport, which is 200 kilometres (124 mi) from Pangong Tso, Ladakh.[51][31] China has also been increasing its footprint with India's neighbours â€“ Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan; so from India having a monopoly in the region, China is now posing a direct challenge to New Delhi's influence in South Asia.[52]\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nMultiple reasons have been cited as the trigger for these skirmishes. One reason stated by observers is Chinese land grabbing involving encroaching upon small parts of enemy territory over a large period, a tactic also referred to as salami slicing.[33][34] In mid-June 2020, Bharatiya Janata Party councillor Urgain Chodon from Nyoma, Ladakh, stated that successive Indian governments (including the current Narendra Modi government) have neglected the border areas for decades and turned a 'blind-eye' to Chinese land grabbing in the region. According to her India has failed miserably in the protection of its borders, and even in 2020, all along the LAC, India has lost land. Her family had also lost grazing land to the Chinese in Koyal in 2018.[53][54] Other local Ladakhi leaders have also acknowledged similar incursions by the Chinese in the region.[55]\\n\\nMIT professor, Taylor Fravel, said that the skirmishes were a response from China to the development of Indian infrastructure in Ladakh, particularly the Darbukâ€“Shyokâ€“DBO Road. He added that it was a show of strength for China amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which had damaged the Chinese economy and its international reputation.[56] According to Yun Sun, a China specialist at the Stimson Center, such road building amounted to \"stabbing China on the back\" in their view. China sees it as a threat to its \"territorial integrity\", which it will not sacrifice for the sake of good relations with India.[57]\\n\\nLobsang Sangay, President of the Tibetan-government-in-exile, stated that China is raising border issues due to internal problems within China and the international pressure being exerted on China over COVID-19.[58][59] Jayadeva Ranade, President of the Centre for China Analysis and Strategy and former National Security Advisory Board member, posited that China's current aggression in the region is to protects it's assets and future plans in Ladakh and adjoining regions such as the Chinaâ€“Pakistan Economic Corridor; as such Chinese troops are not going to withdraw.[60]\\n\\nWang Shida of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations linked the current border tensions to India's decision to abrogate Article 370 and change the status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.[35] Although, Pravin Sawhney agreed with Wang, he postulated that a parliamentary speech by Amit Shah also could have irked the Chinese. In the speech, Shah had declared that Aksai Chin, a disputed region administered by China, was part of the Indian administered Ladakh Union Territory.[61] Furthermore, the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 prompted multiple senior Bharatiya Janata Party ministers, most recently in May 2020, to claim that all that now remained was for India to regain Gilgit-Baltistan.[62] Indian diplomat Gautam Bambawale also stated that New Delhi's moves in August 2019 related to Jammu and Kashmir irked Beijing.[62] In 2014, Rajnath Singh, the then Home Minister of India, the Defence Minister during the 2020 skirmishes, had said that 'China has illegally occupied Aksai Chin in Ladakh'.[63]\\n\\nOther analysts linked the skirmishes as a response to India's growing alliance with the United States. Liu Zongyi, a South Asia specialist at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies told the Financial Times that \"India has been active in many of US plans that target China\". Tanvi Madan, author of Fateful Triangle (a book about the international relations between the US, India and China) stated that India thought that this was \"signal from Beijing\" to \"limit\" its relations with the US.[64] Phunchok Stobdan, a former diplomat of India, stated that \"smaller powers like India and Australia, who have aligned with the U.S., are witnessing a more aggressive China\".[65]\\n\\nIndia's former ambassador to China, Ashok Kantha said that these skirmishes were part of a growing Chinese assertiveness in both the Indo-China border and the South China sea.[56] Retired Indian Army Lt. Gen. Syed Ata Hasnain said that the skirmishes were postâ€“COVID strategic messages from China to its neighbours which would make India prioritize the Himalayan sector over the maritime Indian Ocean region, a more vulnerable area for the Chinese.[66] Raja Mohan, Director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, writes that the growing power imbalance between China and India is the main cause of the dispute, with everything else such as the location of the dispute or international ties of India, being mere detail.[67] These skirmishes have also been linked by multiple people with the Chinese strategy of Five Fingers of Tibet.[68][69][70][71]\\n\\nIncidents\\n\\nThere have been simultaneous efforts by China to occupy land at multiple locations along the Sino-Indian border. Standoffs and skirmishes have taken place at Pangong Tso, Hot Springs, Galwan Valley and Depsang in Ladakh; and in Sikkim as well.[72] Amid de-escalatory talks in Ladakh, on 29 June 2020, China, opened a new front in the border dispute by claiming, for the first time, that Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the disputed territory of Bhutan's Trashigang District.[c][73][74]\\n\\nPangong Tso\\n\\n[d] Part of Pangong Tso/Bangong Co with the Chinese (pink) and Indian (red) claims. The area in the middle is disputed. Khurnak Fort and Sirijap campground are also visible.\\n\\n[Full screen] Northern shore of the Pangong Lake[75]\\n\\nwith \"fingers\" â€“ mountain spurs jutting into the lake[76]\\n\\nOn 5 May, the first standoff began as a clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers at a beach of Pangong Tso, a lake shared between India and Tibet, China, with the Line of Actual Control (LAC) passing through it.[77][78] The Indian soldiers involved in the clash were from 17 Kumaon Regiment.[79] A video showed soldiers from both nations engaging in fistfights and stone-pelting along the LAC.[80] On 10/11 May, another clash took place.[81] A number of soldiers on both sides had sustained injuries. Indian media reported that around 72 Indian soldiers were injured in the confrontation at Pangong Tso, and some had to be flown to hospitals in Leh, Chandi Mandir and Delhi.[82] According to The Daily Telegraph and other sources, China captured 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of Indian-patrolled territory between May and June 2020.[83][84][85]\\n\\nAfter the clash, several Chinese military helicopters were spotted flying near the Indian border on at least two occasions. India deployed several Sukhoi Su-30MKI jets to the area. Reports that Chinese helicopters had repeatedly violated Indian airspace were denied by the Indian government.[86][87] There were reports of Chinese soldiers approaching Indian soldiers with improvised weaponry of barbed wire \"sticks\".[88] By 27 June, the Chinese were reported to have increased military presence on both the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, strengthened their positions near Finger 4 (contrary to what the status quo was in April), and had even started construction of a helipad, bunkers and pillboxes.[89] Satellite imagery from between 12 and 26 June, by Planet Labs shows that the Chinese army increased infrastructure between Finger 4 and 5 on a massive scale, which includes tents, trenches, water tanks and stationed equipment and vehicles along with some camouflaged structures. However, no Chinese helipad and ammunition could be visible from the images. They even inscribed the ancient name of China, Zhongguo (Central state) along with the present day map of China on the shore of the lake between Finger 4 and 5.[90] Both countries have multiple high powered boats for patrolling the Pangong Lake which is 13,900 feet above sea level. While the Indian Army already had multiple boat patrolling teams stationed, the Indian Navy, in July 2020, was called in to match the presence of the Chinese Type 928 B vessels at the lake.[91][92]\\n\\nSikkim\\n\\nAccording to Indian media reports, on 10 May, a spat began when the Chinese intruded into the Muguthang Valley and shouted at the Indian troops: \"this is not your land. This is not Indian territory ... so, just go back.\" An Indian lieutenant responded by punching a Chinese major's nose.[93] The incident developed into a brawl involving 150 soldiers, with opposing sides throwing stones at one another.[49] Seven Chinese and four Indian soldiers were reported to have been injured.[19][94][95] Following the incident, the Indian Army withdrew from the front line the Indian lieutenant that initiated the brawl.[81] A spokesperson from Indian Army's Eastern Command said that the matter had been \"resolved after 'dialogue and interaction' at a local level\" and that \"temporary and short-duration face-offs between border guards do occur as boundaries are not resolved. Troops usually resolve such issues by using mutually established protocols\".[49][50] China did not share details about the incident, and the Chinese Ministry of Defense did not comment on the incident.[96] However, the foreign ministry said that the \"Chinese soldiers had always upheld peace and tranquillity along the border\".[96]\\n\\nEastern Ladakh\\n\\n[Full screen] Locations along the DS-DBO Road\\n\\n(and the traditional customary boundary of China declared 1960).[97]\\n\\nOn 21 May, the Indian Express reported that Chinese troops had entered the Indian territory in the Galwan River valley and objected to the road construction by India within the (undisputed) Indian territory. The road under construction is a branch of the Darbukâ€“Shyokâ€“DBO Road (DSDBO) which leads into the Galwan valley.[e] The report also stated that \"the Chinese pitched 70â€“80 tents in the area and then reinforced the area with troops, heavy vehicles, and monitoring equipment. These all happened not very far from the Indian side.\"[98] On 24 May, another report said that the Chinese soldiers invaded India at three different places: Hot Springs, Patrol Point 14, and Patrol Point 15. At each of these places, around 800â€“1,000 Chinese soldiers reportedly crossed the border and settled at a place about 2â€“3 km (1â€“2 mi) from the border. They also pitched tents and deployed heavy vehicles and monitoring equipment. The report added that India also deployed troops in the area and stationed them 300â€“500 metres (984â€“1,640 ft) from the Chinese.[21][22] According to Indian defence analyst Ajai Shukla, China captured 60 km2 (23 sq mi) of Indian-patrolled territory between May and June 2020.[85][99] According to The Daily Telegraph, China captured 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) of Indian-patrolled territory in the Galwan valley.[83] According to EurAsian Times, the Chinese have a huge build-up including military-style bunkers, new permanent structures, military trucks, and road-building equipment. It quoted an Indian official who called it \"the most dangerous situation since 1962.\"[100] An official, quoted by The Hindu, stated that \"this amounted to a change in the status quo which would never be accepted by India.\"[101] On 30 May, the Business Standard reported that thousands of Chinese soldiers were \"consolidating their positions and digging defences needed to repel Indian attacks.\" They also reported that there were about 18 guns at Pangong Tso and about 12 guns in the Galwan valley providing fire support for the Chinese. Indian troops had taken up positions to block any further advance by the PLA towards the Darbukâ€“Shyokâ€“DBO Road.[102]\\n\\nThe Global Times, which is owned by the Chinese government, blamed India for the stand-offs and claimed that India had \"illegally constructed defence facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region.\" Long Xingchun, a senior research fellow at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, wrote that the border friction was \"an accident\". India is definitely aware that the Galwan Valley region is in Chinese territory.\"[103] On 26 May, paramount leader Xi Jinping[7] urged the military \"to prepare for the worst-case scenarios\" and \"to scale up battle preparedness.\" Furthermore, he said that the COVID-19 pandemic had brought a profound change on the global landscape about China's security and development.[103] On the same day, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the current situation in Ladakh with the National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval and the Chief of Defence Staff, Bipin Rawat.[104] On 27 May 2020, the Chinese Ambassador to India as well as a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the overall situation was stable.[105] However, news reports continued stating that thousands of Chinese soldiers were moving into the disputed regions in Ladakh. This move prompted India to deploy several infantry battalions from the Leh, the provincial capital of Ladakh and some other units from Kashmir.[106][107]\\n\\nHot Springs\\n\\nChinese infrastructure development in Hot Springs is mainly in and around Gogra. Tracks in satellite imagery suggest that PLA troops make forays into Indian territory here.[108] A road also connects this area to the Chinese habitat of Wenquan.[108] Hot Springs area is supposed to be rich in minerals such as gold.[109]\\n\\nGalwan Valley skirmish\\n\\nOn 15 June, Indian[f] and Chinese troops clashed for six hours in a steep section of a mountainous region in the Galwan Valley. The immediate cause of the incident is unknown, with both sides releasing contradictory official statements in the aftermath.[110] Beijing said that Indian troops had attacked Chinese troops first,[111] while on 18 June The Hindu quoted a \"senior government official\" in the Ministry of External Affairs of India who said their troops were ambushed with dammed rivulets being released and boulders being thrown by Chinese troops.[112] The statement said this happened while they were patrolling a disputed area where Colonel Santosh Babu had destroyed a Chinese tent two days earlier.[112] While soldiers carry firearms, due to decades of tradition designed to reduce the possibility of an escalation, agreements disallow usage of firearms, but the Chinese side is reported to possess iron rods and clubs.[113] As a result, hand-to-hand combat broke out, and the Indians called for reinforcements from a post about 2 miles (3.2 km) away. Eventually, up to 600 men were engaged in combat using stones, batons, iron rods, and other makeshift weapons. The fighting, which took place in near-total darkness, lasted for up to six hours.[114] According to senior Indian military officers, Chinese troops used batons wrapped in barbed wire and clubs embedded with nails.[115]\\n\\nThe fighting resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers of 16th Bihar Regiment including its commanding officer, Colonel Santosh Babu.[116][117] While three Indian soldiers died on the spot, others died later due to injuries and hypothermia.[118] Most of the soldiers who were killed fell to their deaths after losing their footing or being pushed off a ridge.[114] The clash took place near the fast-flowing Galwan River, and some soldiers from both sides fell into a rivulet and were killed or injured.[118] Bodies were later recovered from the Shyok River.[117] Some Indian soldiers had also been momentarily taken captive.[118] According to Indian media sources, the mÃªlÃ©e resulted in 43 Chinese casualties.[23][119] At a de-escalation meeting following the incident, the Chinese side accepted that the Chinese commanding officer was also killed in the mÃªlÃ©e.[25][120] The Chinese defence ministry confirmed the existence of Chinese casualties but refused to share the number.[121] Later on, when asked about an Indian minister's assertion about the number of Chinese casualties, China refused to comment.[122] U.S. intelligence reportedly concluded that 35 Chinese soldiers were killed.[20][123] Indian media reported that 10 Indian soldiers were released from Chinese custody in 17 June, including four officers.[10][124] Responding to the reports, the Indian army and the Chinese foreign ministry have both denied that any Indian personnel was taken into custody.[125]\\n\\nOn 16 June, Chinese Colonel Zhang Shuili, spokesperson for the PLA's Western Command, said that the Indian military violated bilateral consensus. He further remarked that \"the sovereignty over the Galwan Valley area had always belonged to China\".[117][126][127] On 18 June, India's Minister of External Affairs made a statement saying that China had \"unilaterally tried to change the status quo\" and that the violence was \"premeditated and planned\".[128][129] The same day, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs said that the Chinese PLA had \"invaded\" the \"contested area\" between India and China.[130] On 19 June, however, Prime Minister Modi declared that \"neither have [China] intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them\", contradicting multiple previous statements by the Indian government.[110][131] Later the Prime Minister's Office clarified that Narendra Modi wanted to indicate the bravery of 16 Bihar Regiment who had foiled the attempt of the Chinese side.[132][133] On 22 June, U.S. News & World Report reported that U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the chief of China's Western Theater Command had sanctioned the skirmish.[134]\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the incident at Galwan, the Indian Army decided to equip soldiers along the border with lightweight riot gear as well as spiked clubs.[135][136] In the mean time, the Indian Air Force also had started the process for emergency procurement of 12 Sukhoi-30 MKI and 21 Mikoyan MiG-29 from Russia.[137][138] On 20 June, India removed restriction on usage of firearms for Indian soldiers along the LAC.[139] Satellite images analysed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute show that the Chinese have increased construction in the Galwan valley since the 15 June skirmish.[140] The Chinese post that was destroyed by Indian troops on 15 June was reconstructed by 22 June, with an expansion in size and with more military movement. Other new defensive positions by both Indian and Chinese forces have also been built in the valley.[141]\\n\\nDepsang plains\\n\\nChinese presence, 18 km (11 mi) inside India's side of the LAC, 30 km (19 mi) south-east of DS-DBO road on the Y-junction or Bottleneck at the Depsang Plains, was reported by Indian media on 25 June 2020, who described movements of troops, heavy vehicles and military equipment. The Chinese claim lines are 5 km further west of bottleneck.[142] Indian Patrol Points (PP) 10, 11, 11A, 12 have been blocked by PLA movement and construction at the bottleneck in Depsang. Analyst Praveen Swami reasoned, if the PLA moves additional troops to Raki river then PP 13 is also cut off. China will have claimed more Indian territory.[143] However, Indrani Bagchi, a diplomatic editor for The Times of India, described the military buildup of the Chinese in and around Depsang are mere diversionary tactics.[144]\\n\\nOngoing construction of Indian infrastructure\\n\\nAmid the standoff, India decided to move an additional 12,000 workers (approximately) to border regions to help complete Indian road projects.[27][28] Around 8,000 workers would help Border Roads Organisation's (BRO) infrastructure project, Project Vijayak, in Ladakh while some workers would also be allocated to other nearby border areas.[145] The workers would reach Ladakh between 15 June and 5 July.[29] The first train with over 1600 workers left Jharkhand on 14 June 2020 for Udhampur, and from there the workers went on to assist BRO at the Sino-Indian border.[29][146] Apart from completing the DSâ€“DBO Road the workers would also be assisting the BRO in the construction of the following roads: \"Phobrangâ€“Masmikla road, Masmiklaâ€“Hot Springs road, Chisumleâ€“Demchok road, Koyulâ€“Photileâ€“Chisumleâ€“Zurasar road and Hanleâ€“Photile road.\"[147] Starting from June, the government announced up to 170% increase in minimum wages for those working along the India-China border, with the highest increase in wages going to employees in Ladakh.[148] Experts state that the development of Indian infrastructure along the border was one of the causes for the standoffs.[30]\\n\\nDiplomatic response\\n\\nIndia's prime minister Narendra Modi holding a meeting with political parties via video conferencing to discuss the situation in Sino-Indian border areas on 19 June.\\n\\nAfter the first melee took place, on 5â€“6 May 2020 at Pangong Tso, Foreign Secretary of India Harsh Vardhan Shringla called Sun Weidong, the Chinese ambassador to India.[149] Then, Ajit Doval reportedly talked to the CPC Politburo member, Yang Jiechi, who is also a top diplomat under CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping.[149] On 28 May, in a press conference, Indian spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, Anurag Srivastava, maintained that there were enough bilateral mechanisms to solve border disputes diplomatically.[150][36] These agreements encompass:[150]\\n\\nFive bilateral treaties between India and China to address border disputes 1993: Agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border\\n\\nAgreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border 1996: Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People's Republic of China on confidence-building Measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border\\n\\nAgreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People's Republic of China on confidence-building Measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border 2005: Protocol on the modalities for the implementation of confidence-building measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border\\n\\nProtocol on the modalities for the implementation of confidence-building measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border 2012: Establishment of a working mechanism for consultation and coordination on Sino-Indian border affairs\\n\\nEstablishment of a working mechanism for consultation and coordination on Sino-Indian border affairs 2013: Border defense cooperation agreement between India and China\\n\\nAdditionally there are other agreements related to the border question such as the 2005 \"Agreement on the Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the India-China Boundary Question\".[151][152] However, some critics say that these agreements are \"deeply flawed\".[153] The Border Personnel Meeting points have seen rounds of military talks in Mayâ€“June; first between colonels, then between brigadiers, and then finally, on 2 June, more than three rounds between major generals.[154][155] All these talks were unsuccessful. Some Indian military sources said that India was still unclear with China's demands. \"When one wants to stall a process, one makes absurd demands...they purposefully made some unreasonable demands\", said the sources.[154] On 6 June 2020, lieutenant general-level talks took place between India and China in Chushul-Moldo.[154][156] The talks involved the Indian commander of Leh-headquartered XIV Corps and the Chinese commander of the Tibet Military District (South Xinjiang Military Region) Maj Gen Liu Lin.[157][156] Prior to talks on 6 June 2016, at lieutenant general-level, the Global Times warned India over American ties.[158]\\n\\nFollowing the Galwan clash, Chinese flags and effigies of paramount leader Xi Jinping were set afire in various places across India and various groups registered their protests in different ways. The Global Times responded to these protests saying that it is \"extremely dangerous for India to allow anti-China groups to stir public opinion\".[159][160] On 17 June 2020, Prime Minister Modi addressed the nation regarding the Galwan skirmish, giving a firm message directed at China over the deaths of Indian soldiers.[161][162] The first communication, since the start of the border dispute, between the foreign ministers of China, Wang Yi and of India, S Jaishankar also happened after the Galwan skirmish.[161] S Jaishankar accused the Chinese actions in Galwan to be \"pre-meditated and planned\".[161] On 20 June, Chinese social media platform WeChat removed the Indian Prime Minister's remarks on the Galwan skirmish,[163] which was uploaded by the Indian Embassy in China. The official statements of the Ministry of External Affairs were also removed. WeChat said that it removed the speech and statements because they divulged in state secrets and endangered national security.[164] The MEA spokesperson's statement on the incident was also removed from Weibo. Following this, the Indian embassy in China issued a clarification on its Weibo account that the post wasn't removed by them, and re-published a screenshot of the statement in Chinese.[165] On 1 July, Prime Minister Modi quit the Chinese social media platform Weibo.[166][167] On 3 July 2020, during a surprise visit to military post in Ladakh, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi denigrate the Chinese Government by saying that 'age of expansionism' is over and that the history has revealed \"expansionist forces have either lost or were forced to turn back.\"[168]\\n\\nThe second round of commanders' meeting was on 22 June. In an 11-hour meeting, the commanders worked out a disengagement outline. On 24 June, this disengagement was then diplomatically acknowledged by both sides during the virtual meeting of the \"Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on China-India Border Affairs\".[140] Chinese spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said that India \"agreed to and withdrew its cross-border personnel in the Galwan Valley and dismantled the crossing facilities in accordance with China's request\".[140][169] The third round of commanders' talks were held on 30 June.[170][171] In the third round of talks, India reiterated its demand for the pullback of the Chinese troops from all key areas including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and the Depsang plains and the restoration of status quo ante in April whereas China emphasised that the military buildup in the region should be reduced.[172] Following the talks, it was reported that Chinese vehicles were seen withdrawing from the Galwan clash point, as well as from Hot Springs and Gogra.[173]\\n\\nAfter futile attempts, a discussion scheduled for 5 July, was held between National Security Advisor of India, Ajit Doval and Foreign Minister of China, Wang Yi, where it was decided that both Indian and Chinese troops would move back 1.8 km from the patrolling point PP 14 which is also the 15 June clash site in the Galwan valley.[174] It was reported that both the troops moved back around 1.5 to 2 km from the PP 14 to create a buffer zone, which would be off-limits for foot patrolling by them for the next 30 days. Chinese troop fully moved out of the clash site, along with thinning down of troops at Hot Springs and Gogra.[175][176] However, the Chinese troops did not withdraw from the Pangong Tso, where they entered 8 km inside Indian patrolling territory.[177][178]\\n\\nEconomic response\\n\\nInitially, India's economic response to China was mainly restricted to patriotic programs on news channels and social media publicity appeals, with very little actual impact on businesses and sales.[179] In May, in response to the border skirmishes, Sonam Wangchuk appealed to Indians to use \"wallet power\" and boycott Chinese products.[180] This appeal was covered by major media houses and supported by various celebrities.[180][181] Following the Galwan Valley clash on 15 June 2020, there were calls across India to boycott Chinese goods.[39][182] The Indian Railways cancelled a contract with a Chinese firm, while the Department of Telecommunication notified BSNL not to use any Chinese made product in upgradations.[42] Mumbai cancelled a monorail contract where the only bidders were Chinese companies; and alternatively said it would focus on finding an Indian technological partner instead.[183] Numerous Chinese contractors and firms were under enhanced scrutiny following the 2020 border friction. Chinese imports are going through additional checks at Indian customs.[184] (In retaliation, customs in China and Honk Kong held up Indian exports).[185] There are also calls for making sure the Chinese do not have access to strategic markets in India.[40] Swadeshi Jagaran Manch said that if the government was serious about making India self-reliant, Chinese companies should not be given projects such as the Delhi-Meerut RRTS.[41][186] Days later, the Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari announced that Chinese firms would be banned from road projects in India.[187][188] The Haryana government cancelled a tender related to a power project in which Chinese firms had put in bid.[189] The Uttar Pradesh government Special Task Force personnel were given orders to delete 52 apps including TikTok and WeChat for security reasons while officials in Madhya Pradesh Police were given an advisory for the same.[190][191]\\n\\nNumerous Indian government officials said that border tensions would have no impact on trade between the two countries.[38] Amid the increased visibility of calls for boycotting Chinese goods in the aftermath of the Galwan incidents, numerous industry analysts warned that a boycott would be counter-productive for India, would send out the wrong message to trade partners, and would have very limited impact on China, since both bilaterally as well as globally India is comparatively a much smaller trade power.[192][193][194][195] Experts also stated that while the boycott campaign was a good initiative, replacement products should be available in the immediate future too.[196] An example taken was the pharmaceutical industry in India which meets 70% of its active pharmaceutical ingredient requirements from China. Dumping in this sector is being scrutinized.[197][198] By the end of June, some analysts agreed that the border tensions between India and China would give the Make in India campaign a boost and increase the pace of achieving self-reliance in some sectors.[196]\\n\\nThe issue of Chinese materials in Indian Army bulletproof vests was again raised in June after the Galwan incidents.[199] V.K. Saraswat, a NITI Aayog member and former DRDO chief, said that it was due to the quality and the pricing that Chinese material was being used instead of Indian products.[200] Bullet-proof vests ordered by the government in 2019 had up to 40% Chinese material. On 20 June, it was reported that development of an Indian bulletproof vest, the \"Sarvatra Kavach\", that is 100% made in India, is near completion.[201] The Maharashtra government put â‚¹5,000 crore (US$700 million) worth of Chinese projects on hold.[202] The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade brought out a list of over a 1000 Made in China goods on which the Government of India has sought comments for imposing import restrictions. Previously, the Department had asked private companies to submit a list of Chinese imports.[203][204] Incidents in Ladakh are also being taken as additional reasons to keep India away from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in which China has a big role.[205]\\n\\nThe unprovoked attack by the Chinese on Indian soil on our brave jawaans has been a huge wake up call and a clarion call for action - we @ TheJSWGroup have a net import of $400mn from China annually and we pledge to bring this down to zero in the next 24 months #BoycottChina Tweet by Parth Jindal, JSW Group on 2 July 2020[206][207]\\n\\nSales of Chinese smartphones in India were not affected in the immediate aftermath of the skirmishes, despite calls for a boycott. The latest model of Chinese smartphone company OnePlus sold out within minutes in India on 18 June, two days after the Galwan clash.[208][209] Xiaomi India's managing director said that the social media backlash would not affect sales, adding that Xiaomi handsets are \"more Indian than Indian handset companies\" and that even many non-Chinese phones, including American handsets, are made in and imported from China.[210][211] Following this, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), an apex traders body in India, made a statement sharply criticising Xiaomi's managing director saying that he was \"trying to please his Chinese masters by downplaying the mood of the nation\".[212][213] TTK Prestige, India's largest kitchen appliances maker, said it would stop all imports from China from 30 September onwards.[214] On 23 June, the government had ordered all e-commerce companies to show the 'country of origin' for products.[215][216] The New York Times reported that on 29 June, as \"part of the tit-for-tat retaliation\", the Indian government, in an interim order, banned 59 Chinese mobile applications including TikTok, WeChat, UC Browser, SHAREit and Baidu Maps.[217][218][219] The Global Times also reported that all the companies of those banned apps would be heavily impacted, particularly TikTok's parent company ByteDance faced a loss of about $6 billion.[220] PRC responded with blocking Indian newspapers and websites in mainland China.[221] On 3 July, Hero Cycles cancelled â‚¹900 crore (US$130 million) worth of projects with China as part of their \"commitment to boycott Chinese products\".[222]\\n\\nPublic response in Kashmir and Ladakh\\n\\n[223] Indiaâ€™s prime minister visits Ladakh on 3 July 2020 where he interacted with Indian military personnel deployed at forward positions.\\n\\nFollowing Galwan clash on 17 June, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah tweeted, \"Those Kashmiris tempted to look towards China as some sort of saviour need only google the plight of Uighur Muslims. Be careful what you wish for...\".[224] He deactivated his Twitter account following the tweet.[224] Khalid Shah, an Associate fellow at ORF, writes that at large the Kashmiri population has \"left no stone unturned to mock the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Chinese belligerence.\"[225] Stone pelters in Srinagar used slogans such as \"cheen aya, cheen aya\" ( transl. China has arrived, China has arrived) to make fun of the Indian security forces while a joke going around is \"cheen kot woat?\" ( transl. where has China reached?). Memes show Xi Jinping dressed in Kashmiri attire with others showing him cooking wazwan. Khalid writes that while China has become a part of many conversations, online and offline, India should be worried that \"Chinese bullying is compared to the actions of the Government of India\".[225] Following the tensions with China, communication lines had been cut in Ladakh in places along the border causing a communication blackout, resulting in local councillors requesting the government for the lines to be restored.[226]\\n\\nInternational response\\n\\nRoman Babushkin, the Russian Deputy Chief of Mission in Delhi, stated on 1 June that Russia maintains that the issue should be solved bilaterally between India and China.[240][241] On 2 June, the Foreign Secretary of India updated and discussed the situation with the Russian Ambassador to India, Nikolay R. Kudashev.[242] Following Galwan, on 17 June, the Ambassador of India in Russia spoke to the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister about the situation.[243] Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary for the President of Russia, said that the situation was being closely watched.[244]\\n\\nRussia initiated virtual talks between RIC (Russiaâ€“Indiaâ€“China) on 22 June.[245][246] Russia had scheduled the RIC trilateral for March but delayed it due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[245] About the border situation between India and China, Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov said that the topics for the meeting were already been agreed upon and \"the RIC agenda does not involve discussing issues that are related to bilateral relations of a country with another member.\"[247] During the trilateral meeting India reminded Russia and China of India's selfless involvement in the Russian and Chinese interests during the World War II, where India helped both the countries by keeping supply lines opened in the Persian Corridor and over the Himalayan Hump.[248]\\n\\nRussia argued that a Sino-Indian confrontation would be a \"bad idea\" for both the countries, for the Eurasian region and the international system. Russia said such confrontation will damage the Chinese legitimacy in the international system and will reduce the existing limited Chinese soft power. It had advised both the countries that it would be a winnable situation for both the countries with no confrontation while giving the example of zero confrontation of the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War.[249] Russia also proposed to hold the first meeting of the defence chiefs of the three countries which China and India also agreed during the meeting. However, Russia reiterated that China and India can sort out its differences through bilateral means without the involvement of the third party including Russia.[248]\\n\\nUnited Nations: Following the Galwan skirmish, the United Nations called for de-escalation and a peaceful resolution.

United States:\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump, on 27 May 2020, offered to mediate between China and India. This offer was rejected by both countries. The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo also raised the issue in a podcast, and referring to China said that these were the kind of actions that authoritarian regimes took and that they can have a real impact.[251][252] Eliot Engel, chief of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, also expressed concern with the situation. He said that \"China was demonstrating once again that it was willing to bully its neighbors\".[253] On 2 June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump discussed the Sino-Indian border situation.[254] In the aftermath of Galwan, the US Secretary of State tweeted condolences to the people of India for the lives lost;[255] while the US Department of State said that the situation was being closely watched.[229] On 18 June Mitch McConnell stated that \"for the sake of grabbing territory, the PLA appears to have instigated the most violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war in 1962\".[256]\\n\\nOn 20 June, US President Donald Trump said that the US is in touch with both China and India to assist them in resolving the tensions.[257] On 25 June, Mike Pompeo stated that American troops were being moved out of Germany and are being redeployed in India and other American allied South East Asian countries because of the recent actions by the Communist Party of China and so as to be appropriately positioned to act as a counter to the PLA.[258] Congressman Ted Yoho made a statement on 27 June saying that, \"China's actions towards India fall in line with a larger trend of the Communist Party of China using the confusion of the COVID-19 pandemic as a cover to launch large scale military provocations against its neighbours in the region, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Vietnam [...] Now is the time for the world to come together and tell China that enough is enough.\" Congressman Ami Bera also expressed concern over the situation at the Indo-China border.[259]\\n\\nOn 1 July, following India's ban on 59 Chinese mobile apps, Mike Pompeo welcomed the decision and said that the move would boost India's 'sovereignty, integrity and national security'.[260]\\n\\nProtests\\n\\nSmall-scale protests against China's actions along the Indo-China border were held in Canada, the United States and Japan.[261][262][263] The Regional Tibetan Youth Congress held protests outside the Chinese Consulate in Toronto.[262] Tibetan-American, Taiwanese-American, and Indian-American held a rally at Times Square in New York raising placards with slogans such as 'Boycott China', 'Tibet stands with India' and 'Stop Chinese Aggression'.[264][265]\\n\\nMedia response\\n\\nChinese media have given little to no attention to the dispute and have downplayed the clashes. In the first month of the standoff, there was only a single editorial piece in the China Daily and the People's Daily.[266] The People's Daily and the PLA Daily did not cover the Galwan clash while the Global Times (Chinese) carried it on page 16.[267] The state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) carried the official military statement on social media with no further coverage.[267] The Global Times ran a number of opinion pieces and one editorial which questioned why China did not disclose its death toll publicly.[267][266][268] China analyst Yun Sun explained that while there may be very little information in the English media of China about the border dispute, there is much more analysis in the Chinese language media.[269] The Chinese media however welcomed Prime Minister Modi's 19 June statement.[110] The Global Times quoted Lin Minwang, a professor at Fudan University's Center for South Asian Studies in Shanghai, as saying that \"Modi's remarks will be very helpful to ease the tensions because as the Prime Minister of India, he has removed the moral basis for hardliners to further accuse China\".[270] In late June China blocked access to all Indian media and newspaper websites.[271][272]\\n\\nIn India, nearly all mainstream newspapers carried front page stories as well as multi-page stories of the incident.[273] Following the 15 June clash in Galwan, Times Now published a list that it said contained the names of the Chinese soldiers who were killed in the clash but cautioned that the information â€œcould be a fake forwardâ€�; multiple sources subsequently said that it was fake news.[274][275][276] Another list reported by Indian media that was said to also show Chinese soldiers who were killed in action was described by Chinese spokesperson Zhao Lijian as fake news.[277] Ahead of the commanders' meeting on 6 June, disinformation campaigns were reportedly run by Chinese state-controlled media as well as corporations. The Chinese broadcasters showed military manoeuvres along the border, reportedly designed to frighten the Indians.[278] TikTok was reported to have given \"shadow bans\" to videos related to the border tension. Statements from India were removed from Chinese social media companies such as Weibo and WeChat.[279][280][281] Following the Galwan clash, international coverage in The New York Times[282] and The Guardian commented on the \"nationalistic\" character of the leaders of both countries and the \"dangers posed by expansionist nationalism\".[283] The BBC described the situation in Galwan as \"an extraordinary escalation with rocks and clubs\".[284][285]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences    5\n",

Collecott points out that for the past two hundred years Brazil has sought to emerge as a serious global economic and political power, a position \"that [Brazil] instinctively feels is her due.\"[17] However, Collecott also argues that while Brazil has certainly fulfilled some of its aspirations and finally started to gain the international recognition it deserves, it perhaps won't quite emerge as a superpower; instead, its current position as an emerging power will allow Brazil to shape the future with more realistic aspirations.[17]\\n\\nIn his 2014 publication, The BRICs Superpower Challenge: Foreign and Security Policy Analysis, professor Kwang Ho Chun carefully assesses the likelihood of the BRICs countries attaining the status of superpowers.[6] Regarding Brazil, Kwang Ho Chun highlights that the country possesses enormous and almost untouched \"strategic\" natural resources, including valuable minerals, a tenth of the world's fresh water and Earth's largest remaining rainforest. Because of this, Kwang Ho Chun feels it is likely that Brazil could gain a dominant role in international relations, especially when it comes to environmental issues.[6] This soft power influence is further enhanced by Brazil's policy makers seeking to engage in as many international organizations as possible and forming alliances, most notably on social, diplomatic and economic issues.[6] Despite its economic potential and Brazil's \"self-image as a country with a great destiny,\" Kwang Ho Chun believes that the country \"falls far short of the levels required for a superpower.\"[6] Supporting his belief, he emphasizes Brazil's apparent lack of \"traditional hard power\" (i.e. military power and global security influence) as a major obstacle. Kwang Ho Chun writes that Brazil has \"little incentive to invest in its military\" as \"the country developed in an environment with hardly any inter-state security threats\", therefore Brazil \"may never be in a position to accumulate enough influence on global security matters to meet the criteria of being a superpower.\"[6] Instead, Ho Chun feels that Brazil will emerge as a great power with an important position in some spheres of influence but limited in others such as international security.[6]\\n\\nChina\\n\\nThe People's Republic of China receives continual coverage in the popular press of its emerging superpower status,[18][19] and has been identified as a rising or emerging economic growth and military superpower by academics and other experts. In fact, the \"rise of China\" has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the Global Language Monitor, as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in social media.[20][21][22][23][24] The term \"Second Superpower\" has been applied by scholars to the possibility that the People's Republic of China could emerge with global power and influence on par with the United States.[25] The potential for the two countries to form stronger relations to address global issues is sometimes referred to as the Group of Two.\\n\\nBarry Buzan asserted in 2004 that \"China certainly presents the most promising all-round profile\" of a potential superpower.[26] Buzan claimed that \"China is currently the most fashionable potential superpower and the one whose degree of alienation from the dominant international society makes it the most obvious political challenger.\" However, he noted this challenge is constrained by the major challenges of development and by the fact that its rise could trigger a counter coalition of states in Asia.[citation needed]\\n\\nParag Khanna stated in 2008 that by making massive trade and investment deals with Latin America and Africa, China had established its presence as a superpower along with the European Union and the United States. China's rise is demonstrated by its ballooning share of trade in its gross domestic product. He believed that China's \"consultative style\" had allowed it to develop political and economic ties with many countries including those viewed as rogue states by the United States. He stated that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation founded with Russia and the Central Asian countries may eventually be the \"NATO of the East\".[27]\\n\\nEconomist and author of Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance Arvind Subramanian argued in 2012 that China will direct the world's financial system by 2020 and that the Chinese renminbi will replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency in 10 to 15 years. The United States' soft power will remain longer. He stated that \"China was a top dog economically for thousands of years prior to the Ming dynasty. In some ways, the past few hundred years have been an aberration.\"[28]\\n\\nLawrence Saez at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, argued in 2011 that the United States will be surpassed by China as military superpower within twenty years. Regarding economic power, the Director of the China Center for Economic Reform at Peking University Yao Yang stated that \"Assuming that the Chinese and U.S. economies grow, respectively, by 8% and 3% in real terms, that China's inflation rate is 3.6% and America's is 2% (the averages of the last decade), and that the renminbi appreciates against the dollar by 3% per year (the average of the last six years), China will become the world's largest economy by 2021. By that time, both countries' GDP will be about $24 trillion.\"[29]\\n\\nHistorian Timothy Garton Ash argued in 2011, pointing to factors such as the International Monetary Fund predicting that China's GDP (purchasing power parity adjusted) will overtake that of the United States in 2016, that a power shift to a world with several superpowers was happening \"Now\". However, China was still lacking in soft power and power projection abilities and had a low GDP/person. The article also stated that the Pew Research Center in a 2009 survey found that people in 15 out of 22 countries believed that China had or would overtake the US as the world's leading superpower.[30]\\n\\nIn an interview given in 2011, Singapore's first premier, Lee Kuan Yew, stated that while China supplanting the United States is not a foregone conclusion, Chinese leaders are nonetheless serious about displacing the United States as the most powerful country in Asia. \"They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second-largest economy in the world. How could they not aspire to be number 1 in Asia, and in time the world?\"[31] The Chinese strategy, Lee maintains, will revolve around their \"huge and increasingly highly skilled and educated workers to out-sell and out-build all others.\"[32] Nevertheless, relations with the United States, at least in the medium term, will not take a turn for the worse because China will \"avoid any action that will sour up relations with the U.S. To challenge a stronger and technologically superior power like the U.S. will abort their 'peaceful rise.'\"[32] Though Lee believes China is genuinely interested in growing within the global framework the United States has created, it is biding its time until it becomes strong enough to successfully redefine the prevailing political and economic order.[33]\\n\\nChinese foreign policy adviser Wang Jisi in 2012 stated that many Chinese officials see China as a first-class power which should be treated as such. China is argued to soon become the world's largest economy and to be making rapid progress in many areas. The United States is seen as a declining superpower as indicated by factors such as poor economic recovery, financial disorder, high deficits gaining close to GDP levels and unemployment, increasing political polarization, and overregulation forcing jobs overseas in China.[34][35][36]\\n\\nIn recent times, consensus has concluded that China has reached the qualifications of superpower status, citing China's growing political clout and leadership in the economic sectors has given the country renewed standings in the International Community. Although China's military projection is still premature and untested, the perceived humiliation of US leadership in failing to prevent its closest allies in joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,[37] along with the Belt and Road Initiative and China's role in the worldwide groundings of the Boeing 737 MAX,[38] was seen as a paradigm shift or an inflection point to the unipolar world order that dominated post-Cold War international relations. University Professor Ã˜ystein TunsjÃ¸ argues that competition between China and the USA will increase, leading to the gap between them decreasing, while the gap between the two countries and the rest of the top ten largest economies will widen.[39] Additionally, economics correspondent, Peter S. Goodman and Beijing Bureau Chief of China, Jane Perlez further stated that China is using a combination of its economic might and growing military advancements to pressure, coerce and change the current world order to accommodate China's interests at the expense of the United States and its allies.[40]\\n\\nThe 2019 Chinese Defense White Paper highlights growing strategic competition between China and the United States although it stops short of the military and ideological confrontation that was shown during the Cold War. Rather, according to Anthony H. Cordesman, although the paper flags both China and the US as competing superpowers, it was far more moderate in its treatment of the US in contrast to the United States view on Chinese military developments. Cordesman states that the paper in the end, was a warning that will shape Sino-American relations as China becomes stronger than Russia in virtually every respect other than its nuclear arsenal.[41]\\n\\nOn August 19, 2019, the United States Studies Centre handed out a report, suggesting that Washington no longer enjoys primacy in the Indo-Pacific. It stress that the War on Terror has greatly distracted US response to China's role in the Pacific; that US military force in the region has greatly atrophied whereas Beijing only grew stronger and more capable since 9/11, to the point that China could now actively challenge the United States over the Indo-Pacific.[42]\\n\\nContrary views\\n\\nTimothy Beardson, founder of Crosby International Holdings, stated in 2013 that he doesn't see \"China becoming a superpower\". He writes that China has basically worked as a manufacturing location for foreign companies, as 83% of all high-tech products made in China were produced for foreign companies.[43] He added that China has problems regarding wages, an aging and declining population, and gender imbalance (with China's 6:5 gender ratio, 1 in 6 males will be unable to find a female partner), and he suggested that such problems would lead to crime. He also pointed out that China continually polluted its environment during its 30 years of economic growth.[43][44]\\n\\nGeoffrey Murray's China: The Next Superpower (1998) argued that while the potential for China is high, this is fairly perceived only by looking at the risks and obstacles China faces in managing its population and resources. The political situation in China may become too fragile to survive into superpower status, according to Susan Shirk in China: Fragile Superpower (2008). Other factors that could constrain China's ability to become a superpower in the future include limited supplies of energy and raw materials, questions over its innovation capability, inequality and corruption, and risks to social stability and the environment.[45]\\n\\nMinxin Pei argued in 2010 that China is not a superpower and it will not be one anytime soon and argued that China faces daunting political and economic challenges.[46] In 2012 he argued that China, despite using its economic power to influence some nations, has few real friends or allies and is surrounded by potentially hostile nations. This situation could improve if regional territorial disputes were resolved and China participated in an effective regional defence system that would reduce the fears of its neighbours. Alternatively, a democratization of China would dramatically improve foreign relations with many nations.[47]\\n\\nAmy Chua stated in 2007 that whether a country is attractive to immigrants is an important quality for a superpower. She also wrote that China lacks the pull to bring scientists, thinkers, and innovators from other countries as immigrants.[48]\\n\\nEuropean Union\\n\\nThe European Union (EU) has been called an emerging superpower by academics.[5][49] Many scholars and academics like T. R. Reid,[50] Andrew Reding,[51] Andrew Moravcsik,[52] Mark Leonard,[53] Jeremy Rifkin,[54] John McCormick,[55] and some politicians like Romano Prodi[56] and Tony Blair,[57] believed that the EU either is, or will become, a superpower in the 21st century. These prognoses, however, all predate the euro crisis and Brexit. See; Political midlife crisis.\\n\\nMark Leonard cites several factors: the EU's large population, large economy, low inflation rates, the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent years,[when?] and certain EU member states' high quality of life (especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week, health care, social services).[58]\\n\\nJohn McCormick believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the Cold War-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening hard power of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union.[59]\\n\\nParag Khanna believes that \"Europe is overtaking its rivals to become the world's most successful empire.\"[60][61] Khanna writes that South America, East Asia, and other regions prefer to emulate \"The European Dream\" rather than the American variant.[60] This could possibly be seen in the African Union and UNASUR. Notably, the EU as a whole has some of the world's largest and most influential languages being official within its borders.[62]\\n\\nAndrew Reding also takes the future EU enlargement into account. An eventual future accession of the rest of Europe, the whole of Russia, and Turkey, would not only boost its economy, but it would also increase the EU's population to about 800 million, which he considers almost equal to that of India or China. The EU is qualitatively different from India and China since it is enormously more prosperous and technologically advanced.[51] Turkish PM Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan said in 2005: \"In 10 or 15 years, the EU will be a place where civilizations meet. It will be a superpower with the inclusion of Turkey.\"[63]\\n\\nRobert J. Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed, and in the 21st century it does not only refer to states with military power, but also to groups such as the European Union, with strong market economics, young, highly educated workers savvy in high technology, and a global vision.[64] Friis Arne Petersen, the Danish ambassador to the US, has expressed similar views but has conceded that the EU is a \"special kind of superpower\", one that has yet to establish a unified military force that exerts itself even close to the same level as many of its individual members.[65]\\n\\nAdditionally, it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence: that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths (as of its low-profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law)[59] and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones;[66] however, it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States.[67]\\n\\nBarry Buzan notes that the EU's potential superpower status depends on its \"stateness\". It is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower. Buzan states that the EU is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth, its \"political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development, particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy\" constrains it from being a superpower.[26]\\n\\nAlexander Stubb, the Finnish foreign minister, has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest political union, single market and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defence or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the major factor constraining the EU's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system; other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some Europeans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the Lisbon Treaty (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry (EEAS, established in 2010), develop a common EU defence, hold one collective seat at the United Nations Security Council and G8, and address what he described as the \"sour mood\" toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.[68]\\n\\nContrary views\\n\\nSome commentators do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. \"The EU is not and never will be a superpower\", according to the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband.[69] Lacking a unified foreign policy and with an inability to project military power worldwide, the EU lacks \"the substance of superpowers\", who by definition have \"first of all military reach [and] possess the capacity to arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government's will.\"[70] EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that the high degree of involvement in conflicts such as the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict is used by the EU largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally, particularly in contrast to the US.[71]\\n\\nThe Economist's Robert Lane Greene notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status, noting especially that the EU's creation of a global response force rivalling the superpower's (United States) is \"unthinkable\".[72] Similarly, Colin S. Gray finds that â€œEU-Europe remains a political pygmy and all but military zero in any collective sense.â€�[73]\\n\\nBritain's Michael Howard has warned against the \"worry\" that many Europeans are pushing for greater EU integration to counterbalance the United States,[74] while Europe's total reliance on soft (non-military) power is in part because of its lack of a \"shared identity.\"[75] While to some the European Union should be a \"model power\" unafraid of using military force and backing free trade, its military shortcomings argue against superpower status.[76]\\n\\nAccording to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the European Union did not produce a real \"union\" but a \"misnomer.\" It failed to use the years of â€œEurope whole and freeâ€� to make Europe truly whole and its freedom firmly secure. The notion of Europe as â€œa political and military heavyweight\" became \"increasingly illusory.â€� Europe, once the center of the West, became an extension of a West whose defining player is America.[77]\\n\\nGeorge Osborne, former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has also pointed out the economic crisis of the European Union. Osborne said, \"The biggest economic risk facing Europe doesn't come from those who want reform and re-negotiation. It comes from a failure to reform and renegotiate. It is the status quo which condemns the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline.\" Osborne also said that the EU is facing growing competition with global economic powers like China, India and the US, and the European Union should \"reform or decline.\"[78][79][80]\\n\\nIn 2016, the United Kingdom, the EU's fourth largest financial contributor after Germany, France and Italy,[81] voted to leave the European Union. This represented the first time a member state would be leaving the organization and its antecedent institutions since the European Economic Community was established in 1957.\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nThe Republic of India has seen considerable coverage of its potential of becoming a superpower, both in the media and among academics.[82][83] In 2006, Newsweek and the International Herald Tribune joined several academics in discussing India's potential of becoming a superpower.[82][84]\\n\\nAnil Gupta is almost certain that India will become a superpower in the 21st century. As an example, he states that due to India's functional institutions of democracy and its relatively corruption-free society, it will emerge as a desirable, entrepreneurial and resource and energy-efficient superpower in the near future. He had predicted that by 2015 India would overtake China to be the fastest growing economy in the world and predicts an emergence as a full-fledged economic superpower by 2025. In addition to that, he states, India has the potential to serve as a leading example of how to combine rapid economic growth with fairness towards and inclusion of those at the bottom rungs of the ladder and of efficient resource utilization, especially in energy.[85] India became the world's fastest growing economy in 2015 and did continue to do so in 2016.[86]\\n\\nEconomists and Researchers at Harvard University have projected India's 7% projected annual growth rate through 2024 would continue to put it ahead of China, making India the fastest growing economy in the world.[87][88] In 2017, Center for International Development at Harvard University, published a research study,[89] projecting that India has emerged[89] as the economic pole of global growth by surpassing China and is expected to maintain its lead over the coming decade.[89]\\n\\nRobyn Meredith points out that the average incomes of European and Americans are higher than Chinese and Indians, and hundreds of millions of Chinese as well as Indians live in poverty, she also suggested that economic growth of these nations has been the most important factor in reducing global poverty of the last two decades, as per the World Bank report.[8] Amy Chua adds to this, that India still faces many problems such as \"pervasive rural poverty, entrenched corruption, and high inequality just to name a few\". However, she notes that India has made tremendous strides to fix this, stating that some of India's achievements, such as working to dismantle the centuries-old caste system and maintaining the world's largest diverse democracy, are historically unprecedented.[48]\\n\\nFareed Zakaria pointing out that India's young population coupled with the second-largest English-speaking population in the world could give India an advantage over China. He also believes that while other industrial countries will face a youth gap, India will have many young people, or in other words, workers, and by 2050, its per capita income will rise by twenty times its current level. According to Zakaria, another strength that India has is that its democratic government has lasted for 60 years, stating that a democracy can provide for long-term stability, which has given India a name.[90]\\n\\nClyde V. Prestowitz Jr., founder and president of the Economic Strategy Institute and former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan administration, has predicted that \"It is going to be India's century. India is going to be the biggest economy in the world. It is going to be the biggest superpower of the 21st century.\"[91]\\n\\nAccording to the report named \"Indian Century: Defining India's Place in a Rapidly Changing Global Economy\" by IBM Institute for Business Value, India is predicted to be among the world's highest-growth nations over the coming years.[92][93][94]\\n\\nContrary views\\n\\nParag Khanna wrote in 2008 that he believes that India is not, nor will it become a superpower for the foreseeable future, lagging decades behind China in both development and strategic appetite.[95] Instead, he believes India will be a key swing state along with Russia.[96] He says that India is \"big but not important\", has a highly successful professional class, while millions of its citizens still live in poverty. He also writes that it matters that China borders a dozen more countries than India and is not hemmed in by a vast ocean and the world's tallest mountains.[97] However, in a recent article written by Khanna, he says that India, along with China, will grow ever stronger, while other powers, like Europe, muddle along.[98]\\n\\nLant Pritchett, reviewing the book In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India, writes that, while India has had impressive growth and has some world-class institutions, several other indicators are puzzlingly poor. The malnutrition and the coverage of immunization programs are at levels similar or worse than in many sub-Saharan African nations. In the Demographic and Health Surveys, India's child malnutrition was the worst of the 42 nations with comparable and recent data.[99] Adult literacy is 61%. In one study, 26% of teachers were absent from work and 1/3 of those showing up did not teach. 40% of health care workers were absent from work. Caste politics in India remains an important force. Pritchett argues that a very large population, a very long statistical \"tail\" of high quality students, and some very good higher education institutions gives a misleading impression of Indian education. Indian students placed forty-first and thirty-seventh in a study comparing students in the two Indian states Odisha and Rajasthan to the forty-six nations in the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.[99]\\n\\nManjari Chatterjee Miller, assistant professor of international relations at Boston University, argues that India is a \"would-be\" great power but \"resists its own rise\".[100] Three factors contribute to this stagnation, she argues. First, New Delhi's foreign policy decisions are highly individualistic.[100] \"This autonomy, in turn, means that New Delhi does very little collective thinking about its long-term foreign policy goals, since most of the strategic planning that takes place within the government happens on an individual level.\"[101] Second, a dearth of think tanks helps insulate Indian foreign policymakers from outside influences.[100] \"U.S. foreign policymakers, by contrast, can expect strategic guidance from a broad spectrum of organizations that supplement the long-term planning that happens within the government itself.\"[102] Third, many of India's political elites believe that the country's inevitable rise is a Western construct that has placed unrealistic expectations on India's economic growth forecasts and its international commitments.[100] By contrast, Miller notes that Chinese political leaders pay very close attention to the international hype surrounding their country's growing stature.[100] Miller concludes that \"India's inability to develop top-down, long-term strategies means that it cannot systematically consider the implications of its growing power. So long as this remains the case, the country will not play the role in global affairs that many expect.\"[103]\\n\\nRussia\\n\\nThe Russian Federation has been suggested as a potential candidate for resuming superpower status in the 21st century.[7][104][105] Russia has seen some discussion regarding its potential of re-emerging as a superpower, while others have made the assertion that it is already a superpower.[106] In 2009, Hugo Chavez, late President of Venezuela whose government was noted to have enjoyed warm relations with the Kremlin, stated that \"Russia is a superpower\", citing waning American influence in global affairs, and suggested the ruble be elevated to a global currency.[107] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Russia an important superpower, praising its effectiveness as an ally of Israel.[108] In his 2005 publication entitled Russia in the 21st Century: The Prodigal Superpower, Steven Rosefielde, a professor of economics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, predicted that Russia would emerge as a superpower before 2010 and augur another arms race. However, Rosefielde noted that such an end would come with tremendous sacrifice to global security and the Russian people's freedom.[109]\\n\\nIn 2014, Stephen Kinzer of The Boston Globe compared Russia's actions with its own neighbouring territories, to those of \"any other superpower\", taking Ukraine and Crimea as examples.[110] A mixed opinion has been offered by Matthew Fleischer of the Los Angeles Times: he contends that Russia will not become a superpower unless climate change eats away at the permafrost that covers, as of March 2014, two-thirds of the country's landmass. The absence of this permafrost would reveal immense stores of oil, natural gas, and precious minerals, as well as potential farmland, which would allow Russia to \"become the world's bread basketâ€”and control the planet's food supply.\"[111]\\n\\nRussian news agency RIA Novosti called Russia a \"superpower\" after its actions in Syria,[112] and after the formation of a coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Benny Avni of the New York Post called Russia the \"world's new sole superpower\".[113]\\n\\nContrary views\\n\\nDuring the annual state of the nation address at the Moscow Kremlin in December 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin denied any Russian aspiration to be a superpower. He was quoted saying: \"We do not aspire to be called some kind of superpower, understanding that as a claim to world or regional hegemony. We do not infringe on anyone's interests, we do not force our patronage on anyone, or try to teach anyone how to live.\"[114][115]\\n\\nForbes writer Jonathan Adelman has summarized the arguments against Russia's superpower potential thus: \"While Russia may have grabbed the headlines for hosting the forthcoming Olympics and Edward Snowden, it's no super power. Russia has a trade profile of a Third World country, a GNP the size of Canada, which is less than 15 percent of the United States GDP, no soft power, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Wall Street or highly rated universities.\"[116][117]\\n\\nSeveral analysts commented on the fact that Russia showed signs of an aging and shrinking population. Fred Weir said that this severely constricts and limits Russia's potential to re-emerge as a central world power.[118] Former political journalist Peter Brown wrote that Russia \"would like to reclaim the superpower status it held for nearly 40 years after World War II,\" but in the 21st century \"may lack the combination of economic and military power\" to do so. He said that \"Russia won't be a superpower anytime soon,\" citing Russia's shrinking population, high levels of poverty and poor public health.[119] In 2011, British historian and professor Niall Ferguson also highlighted the negative effects of Russia's declining population, and suggested that Russia is on its way to \"global irrelevance\".[120] Russia has, however, shown a slight population growth since 2012, partly due to immigration.[121] The number of Chinese in the Russia's Far East has been growing.[122] Russia's demographic problems continued in 2015.[123]\\n\\nNathan Smith of the National Business Review has said that despite Russia having potential, it did not win the new \"Cold War\" in the 1980s, and thus makes superpower status inaccurate.[124]\\n\\nHistorical potential of Japan\\n\\nIn the 1980s, many political and economic analysts predicted that Japan would eventually accede to superpower status, due to its large population, huge gross domestic product and high economic growth at that time and the expectation that it would surpass the economy of the United States.[125][126][127] Though still the world's tenth-largest population and third-largest economy as of 2016 in terms of nominal GDP, Japan has faced an ongoing period of weak growth since the Lost Decade of the 1990s, and has been suffering from an aging population since the early 2000s, eroding its potential as a superpower.[128]\\n\\nJapan had superpower potential, because the demographic problem could be mended by recruiting more overseas workers. Nearby countries such as the Philippines could become a major source of the manpower Japan needs to sustain its economic recovery.[129] Japan was ranked as the world's fourth most-powerful military in 2015.[130] The military capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces are held back by the pacifist 1947 constitution. However, there is a gradual push for a constitutional amendment. On 18 September 2015, the National Diet enacted the 2015 Japanese military legislation, a series of laws that allow Japan's Self-Defense Forces to collective self-defense of allies in combat for the first time under its constitution.[131] In May 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set a 2020 deadline for revising Article 9, which would legitimize the JSDF in the Constitution.[132] Japan is a cultural superpower in terms of the large-scale influence Japanese food, electronics, automobiles, music, video games, and anime have on the world.[133][134]\\n\\nSee also

       "India\\n\\noi-Oneindia Staff\\n\\nBy oneindia staff\\n\\nNew Delhi, July 08: Indian and Chinese armies are expected to carry out a joint verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the dismantling of temporary infrastructure and withdrawal of troops by China are completed in the friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.\\n\\nThey said the two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on finalising modalities for restoring normalcy and bringing back peace and tranquillity in the region after the verification of the disengagement exercise is completed.\\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\nNewest First Oldest First I have spoken with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar a number of times about this. Chinese took incredibly aggressive actions and Indians have done their best to respond to that: Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State on India-China border tensions Indian and Chinese armies are expected to carry out a joint verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the dismantling of temporary infrastructure and withdrawal of troops by China complete in eastern Ladakh. The disengagement process may have kicked off at the immediate troop confrontation sites in eastern Ladakh but the â€œclear and present threatâ€� from China will remain till there is actual de-induction of its major military build-up along the Line of Actual Control in the high-altitude region Disengagement between troops of India and China has been completed today at Patrolling Point 15. The Chinese troops have moved back by approximately 2 kms: Indian Army Sources (ANI) â€œPM has said something while the army said something else. So we believe the army. Army commandants are saying that Chinese have planted structures 18 km into the Indian border,â€� Pande alleged. Criticizing prime minister Narendra Modiâ€™s handling of the twin crisis coronavirus outbreak and the border stand-off with China, veteran West Bengal minister Sadhan Pande on Tuesday said the government had been caught on the wrong foot. The buffer zone is important to avoid any eyeball to eyeball confrontation as it would increase the risk of clashes between the two sides. The buffer zones would be monitored through drones and satellites and patrolling would be restricted for sometime. While most issues at the stand off points would be resolved over the coming week, it may take some time to restore normalcy at the Pangong Tso. Once the troops move out of the depth areas, there would be restoration of status quo of April 2020. Australia-Japan-US Defense Ministersâ€™ Meeting joint statement reinforced strong opposition to use of force in South China sea to alter status quo and reaffirmed importance of freedom of navigation; expressed deep concern over China's imposition of national security law in Hong Kong The buffer zones are being created to temporarily restrict patrolling activities of both armies in the region. This would however be a temporary step until issues are fully settled. Curtailing patrolling rights would only be temporary and if it becomes a long term feature then it would undermine the control and presence of the Indian troops. According to them, Oliâ€™s recent anti-India remarks were â€œneither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriateâ€�. Over the weekend, the Chinese envoy to Nepal, Hou Yanqi was involved in hectic parleys with various factions of the NCP to save the regime. Top NCP leaders, including Prachanda, have been seeking Oliâ€™s resignation. India has moved over 30,000 troops and heavy weaponry all along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, to match China's build-up The two armies are also working on a buffer zone of at least up to 4 kilometres at Gogra and Hot Springs. It may be recalled that the Indian and Chinese armies had already created a buffer zone of 4 kilometres at the Galwan Valley, the site where the deadly clash took place on June 15. The Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army has withdrawn up to 2 kilometres from Patrolling Point 15, Hot Springs. Officials say that a similar exercise would be undertaken at Gogra, PP-17 by today in the evening. India's Sukhoi-30 MKI and MiG-29 fighters, Apache attack and Chinook heavy-lift helicopters are continuing with their round-the-clock operations after being inducted into forward air bases One of the major aims behind the intrusion of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) into the PP-14 area was to threaten the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie road, which India completed last year. Buffer zones were a â€œmutual temporary arrangementâ€� to ensure there were â€œno inadvertent clashesâ€� between the rival troops during the disengagement process, officials have said. After the buffer zone, the next step being considered is the withdrawal of troops that have been built up along the LAC by both sides. Patrols will resume at the friction points in the future after current tensions de-escalate and plans are in place for joint verification of the disengagement in the coming days at several spots in eastern Ladakh. While Galwan valley has been vacated and a 4 km buffer zone has been established, which will not be disturbed till the next stage of disengagement. Satellite images, physical verification show Chinese troops have moved back from friction point in Galwan. Disengagement by the Chinese at the Gogra Posst will be completed in the next 2 or 3 days. A verification would be done by the Indian Army. During the talks between the military commanders, it was decided that a 1.5 kilometre buffer zone must be created in all the stand off areas. Union IT and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday said India is an \"important digital power\" and will not compromise on its data sovereignty. While keeping in view the disengagement agreement, Indian troops withdrew 1.5 kilometres after the Chinese pulled back its troops at the Galwan Valley. There would however be a moratorium on patrolling for sometime as agreed during the military commander level talks held on June 30. The sources said the mutual disengagement of troops at the two friction points is likely to be completed within two days, and that there has been \"substantial\" withdrawal of forces by Chinese military from the areas. Gogra and Hot Springs are among the key friction points where the two armies were in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation for the last eight weeks. Chinese military removed temporary infrastructure and continued gradual withdrawal of troops from face-off sites in Hot Springs and Gogra in eastern Ladakh for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, and the Indian Army is keeping a strict vigil on their rearward movement, government sources said. China exports products worth USD 74 billion to India annually. Leaders in the trading community are of the opinion that our industries could be endangered due to non-availability of ready stock due to disrupted supply from China for industrial products such as machinery parts, bearings and other parts,\" FAIVM general secretary V K Bansal said in a letter to the Prime Minister. The Indian Army officer killed the clash was the commanding officer of a battalion at Galwan. There was no firing. Apparently the two sides clashed with stones and rods. There are various accounts on the number of casualties on the Chinese side. Some accounts suggest 5, while the others say it is 3. However there is no official word on the same. The visit by Army Chief General M M Naravane to Pathankot has been cancelled. National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Tuesday said if the Chinese can \"shoot dead\" three Indian soldiers during the 'de-escalation process', one can imagine how serious the situation must have been in the first place. Earlier in the day, the Indian Army said an officer and two soldiers were killed in a violent confrontation with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley on Monday. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be discussing the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a short while from now. Singh has already met Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, the three service chiefs and External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar. We will eventually learn about the details of what happened in Ladakh. That is our right. But right now, we must grieve with & stand by the families of our martyred soldiers. And stand solidly in support of our armed forces. â€” anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) June 16, 2020 Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra's tweet: Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh has briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the situation along the Line of Actual Control. Mehbooba Mufti took to Twitter to say that the nation wants to know why there is no talk of retaliation. Taking to Twitter, Mufti wrote,''Seems like China has hijacked the aggressive â€˜ghar main ghuske marengayâ€™ militaristic approach.

Congrress leader Shashi Tharoor: The tragic news from Ladakh is shocking & calls for resolute handling by our Govt. Meanwhile, let us bow our heads in tribute to the three martyrs who gave their lives to protect India, and honour those who serve on our borders every day, risking their lives for our nation. Both sides have been ascertaining that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is important to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas. China has lodged solemn representations and protests to India. Here, we are sternly demanding India to earnestly abide by the relevant agreement and strictly restrain their frontline troops. They should not cross the borderlines says Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh has met with External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar and Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat and discussed the situation along the LAC.

He also took pot shot on Prime Minister's 56-inch chest. Indian troops seriously violated consensus of the two sides by illegally crossing the border twice and carrying out provocative attacks on Chinese soldiers. This resulted in serious physical clashes, Chinaâ€™s Global Times said while quoting foreign minister, Wang Yi. Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda on Tuesday termed as 'disturbing' the violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley and said the government should offer a clearer picture to the nation on the border issue. He sought to know as to how Indian soldiers lost their lives during a de-escalation process and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh should come out with a clearer picture. \"Saddened by the news of the martyrdom of our boys in the Galwan Valley. I salute their indomitable courage, selflessness and sacrifice,\" said VK Singh. The editor of Global Times posted on Twitter, â€œ based on what I know, Chinese side also suffered casualties in the Galwan Valley physical clash. I want to tell the Indian side, donâ€™t be arrogant and misread Chinaâ€™s restraint as being weak. China doesnâ€™t want to have a clash with India, but we donâ€™t fear it.â€� The talks between the two sides are still continuing and efforts are on to defuse tensions between India and China after a violent clash occurred. The situation still remains fluid in Ladakh. Hectic talks are on to defuse the tensions along the Line of Actual Control. The Congress has termed as \"shocking\" and \"unacceptable\" the death of an Indian Army officer and two soldiers in a violent face-off with the Chinese troops, and asked Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to confirm the development. \"Shocking, Unbelievable and Unacceptable! Will the Raksha Mantri confirm,\" Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter. Saddened by the news of the martyrdom of our boys in the Galwan Valley. I salute their indomitable courage, selflessness & sacrifice.\\n\\n\\n\\nJai Hind!! â€” Vijay Kumar Singh (@Gen_VKSingh) June 16, 2020 Saddened by the news of the martyrdom of our boys in the Galwan Valley. I salute their indomitable courage, selflessness and sacrifice, Union Minister, General V K Singh said. AIMIM chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi took to Twitter to condemn the killings of three Indian army personnel. \"India stands with the 3 brave martyrs who were killed by China today in Galwan. My thoughts are with families of Colonel & 2 brave soldiers. The commanding officer was leading from the front. The government must avenge these killings & ensure that their sacrifice was not in vain,\" Owaisi tweeted.

(Express Photo: Shuaib Masoodi)\\n\\nThe stand-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh is now in its ninth week. A conversation between the two foreign ministers, three rounds of Corps Commander-level talks, other discussions at the diplomatic and military levels have failed to break the impasse. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the â€œenemies of India have seen the fire and fury of our forcesâ€�, and warned that â€œIndiaâ€™s commitment to peace should not be seen as its weaknessâ€�.\\n\\nWhat options are available to India to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the region?\\n\\nOPTION 1: Evict the Chinese by force, destroy what they built\\n\\nThe most straightforward course of action would be for Indian soldiers to push out the Chinese from the new areas that they have occupied in the last eight weeks, and destroy all the infrastructure China has built on the Indian side of the LAC.\\n\\nThis, however, will almost certainly lead to military escalation and in a full-blown war. Even the limited attempt to evict the Chinese from the observation post near PP14 on June 15 led to the clash in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese lost their lives.\\n\\nIn the areas where the Chinese have come over to the Indian side of the LAC, the Indian Army may not be well disposed, due to constraints of terrain or infrastructure, to execute such a precisely targeted operation successfully. Also, some of the areas that the Chinese have entered are claimed by both countries, with no agreement over the alignment of the LAC. This will make it difficult for New Delhi to garner international support for its move.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Unlikely.\\n\\nAlso from Explained | Tokyo 2014 to Ladakh 2020: PM Modiâ€™s full circle to draw line for Beijing\\n\\nA map of the Ladakh region. (Express) A map of the Ladakh region. (Express)\\n\\nOPTION 2: â€˜Quid pro quoâ€™ tactic\\n\\nThere are areas on the LAC that are not strongly defended by the Chinese, where Indian soldiers can move in and occupy a swathe of Chinese territory. At the negotiating table, the two sides can then exchange the occupied territories, and restore status quo ante. This option has been discussed at the highest levels â€” most noticeably in the 2012 policy document â€˜Non-alignment 2.0â€™ â€” and is believed to have also been war-gamed by the military. According to strategic affairs analyst Ashley Tellis, the 2013 Chinese incursion in Depsang was reversed within three weeks after the Indian Army moved to the Chinese side in Chumar, and did some construction of their own. In the negotiations that followed, the two sides agreed to return to their earlier positions.\\n\\nThe â€˜QPQâ€™ option exists even now, as the entire LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh cannot be physically defended by the Chinese army. But such proactive options have a certain window of opportunity, which may have been lost after eight weeks of tensions. Also, it carries the risk of military escalation, as the Chinese may misread it as a larger military attack, or see it as a provocation.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Unlikely, but possible.\\n\\nAlso read | India should avoid strategic miscalculation: China on LAC standoff\\n\\nOPTION 3: Hold the line and negotiate\\n\\nIn this scenario, the Indian Army â€œholds the lineâ€� by deploying in strength along the LAC to ensure that the Chinese do not ingress deeper. This stops the Chinese at their current positions, while preparing Indian defences and allowing for a buildup of troops for any eventuality that may arise. The forces also get time to build up arsenal and stocks through import of critical material.\\n\\nTalks are held simultaneously, including, if required, at the highest political level, to ensure the Chinese side returns to status quo ante. These are backed up by non-military moves against the Chinese, in the economic and trade domains, as has been witnessed recently. It allows New Delhi to demonstrate its resolve to the Chinese, while signalling to the world that it is a responsible power that would not be reckless.\\n\\nðŸ“£ Express Explained is now on Telegram.

It could allow for the formation of newer diplomatic, security, and trade partnerships to put China under pressure.\\n\\nThe downside is the prolongation of the standoff, possibly into winter, which would impose a heavy logistic and financial burden on the Indian Army. It also carries the risk of an accidental escalation, in case of an incident between soldiers on two sides who are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball in an environment of high tension for a long time. And the biggest risk is that the Chinese may not actually concede anything on the ground even as Indians continue to hold the line â€” the continued Chinese deployment and new constructions could alter the status quo permanently.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Most likely.\\n\\nOPTION 4: A limited war\\n\\nIt can be limited in terms of geography â€” say, only in Ladakh, or in time â€” for a few days before India unilaterally declares a cessation of hostilities. This would be a very bold move; it carries the greatest risk of a full-blown war against a well-prepared adversary. Also, China has integrated theatre commands, where the full Sino-Indian border is seen as a single front under their western theatre command. It may not keep the war limited to the areas India would want it to, and stretch the Indian military fully.\\n\\nThis option also needs a heavy commitment of military resources, which will impact Indiaâ€™s post-Covid economic revival. There will be no global appetite to take sides, and Pakistan could simultaneously open another front. The only advantage is of sending China a strong message â€” because a bigger power, in this case China, has to win unequivocally, whereas not getting defeated can in itself be seen as a win for India.\\n\\nPROBABILITY: Highly unlikely.\\n\\nðŸ“£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Under Mao Zedong, China more than doubled its size by annexing Tibet and Xinjiang, making it the worldâ€™s fourth- largest country in area. Under Xi Jinping, Chinaâ€™s expansionism increasingly threatens its neighbours, big and small. Xiâ€™s regime has just opened a new territorial front against one of the worldâ€™s smallest countries, Bhutan, by disputing its eastern borders.\\n\\nIn this light, the outcome of Chinaâ€™s aggression against India will have an important bearing on Asian security. If the current India-China military disengagement ends up like the 2017 Doklam disengagement in making China the clear winner, an emboldened Xi regime will likely become a greater threat to neighbours.\\n\\nChinaâ€™s strategy after its disastrous 1979 invasion of Vietnam has been to win without fighting. Deception, concealment and surprise have driven Chinaâ€™s repeated use of force â€” from seizing the Johnson Reef in 1988 and the Mischief Reef in 1995 to occupying the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and now vantage locations in Ladakh. It has changed the South China Seaâ€™s geopolitical map without firing a shot or incurring any international costs.\\n\\nChina has displayed its art of deception even in its disengagement process with India. The first accord of June 6 to disengage collapsed after the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) erected structures on Indian territory and then ambushed and killed Indian Army men on verification patrol. The disengagement process restarted after Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi seemed to let China off the hook with his June 19 speech at the all-party meeting. But the fresh process became a ruse for PLA to encroach on two new Indian areas â€” the Depsang Y-Junction; and the Galwan Valley site of the ambush killings.\\n\\nIndia and China are now in their third disengagement series. But while the previous two abortive rounds followed military-level talks, the latest cycle is being driven politically. We now know that Modiâ€™s July 3 Ladakh visit, and his tough words there, were essentially designed to create domestic political space for his government to seek de-escalation with China. Barely 48 hours after his visit, India and China hammered out a disengagement deal.\\n\\nWill the latest deal stick? Having encroached on key areas that overlook Indiaâ€™s defences, PLA is sitting pretty. A full return to status quo ante as sought by India seems remote, thanks to Indiaâ€™s own mixed signals. Moreover, by encroaching on additional areas behind the previous disengagement facade, China has armed itself with greater leverage to impose a revised status quo, including by applying the precept that â€œpossession is nine-tenths of the lawâ€�.\\n\\nDisengagement (pullback of rival forces from close proximity), if not de-escalation (ending hostilities through demobilisation of forces), meshes well with Chinaâ€™s interest in presenting India a fait accompli. Removing the threat of an Indian counteroffensive or Indian tit-for-tat land grab will help China win without fighting.\\n\\nThis explains why China has accepted disengagement â€” but on its terms. This is illustrated in the Galwan Valley, where India has pulled back from its own territory and created a â€œbuffer zoneâ€� on its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). These steps, though temporary, create a new, China-advantageous status quo that PLA could seek to enforce because it keeps India out of Chinaâ€™s newly-claimed zone â€” the Galwan Valley.\\n\\nThe risk that, like at Doklam, the current disengagement may not end well for India is high. Instead of demonstrating strength and resolve, India has displayed zeal to end the stand-off, despite its armed forces being mobilised for possible war.\\n\\nAt a time when the international environment is beginning to turn against China, India could have prolonged the stand-off until winter to compel restoration of status quo ante. But, instead, it has kicked status quo ante down the road and settled merely for disengagement. This allows China to hold on its core territorial gains and trade the marginal occupied territories for Indian concessions, as part of its well-known â€œadvance 10 miles and retreat six milesâ€� strategy.\\n\\nFar from imposing military costs, India has shied away even from trade actions against the aggressor, as if to preserve the option of another Modi-Xi summit. Indiaâ€™s steps so far (banning Chinese mobile apps and announcing an intent to restrict Chinese investment in some areas) have been designed to assuage public anger at home, but without imposing substantive costs on Beijing or damaging bilateral relations.\\n\\nIn 1967, a weak India, while recovering from the 1962 and 1965 wars, gave China a bloody nose. But in 2017 and again now, after its soldiers displayed extraordinary bravery in tackling Chinaâ€™s aggression, a nuclear-armed India hastily sought disengagement. Its decision-makers remain loath to fundamentally change the China policy even when faced with aggression.\\n\\nBite by bite, China has been nibbling away at Indiaâ€™s borderlands, even as successive Indian PMs have sought to appease it. When political calculations trump military factors and a nation lives by empty rhetoric, it can win neither war nor peace.\\n\\nThe present path risks locking India in a â€œno war, no peaceâ€� situation with China and imposing mounting security costs. This path aids Chinaâ€™s time-tested strategy of attrition, friction and containment to harass, encumber, encircle, deceive and weigh India down.\\n\\nIf India wants Himalayan peace, it must make China pay for its aggression to help create a deterrent effect. The present aggression â€” the most serious since the 1960s â€” resulted from India letting China off the hook too easily in 2017, allowing it to capture Doklam. And if China emerges the winner from the current crisis, its next aggression could be worse. Only a chastened China saddled with high costs and loss of face will rein in its aggressive expansionism.\\n\\nBrahma Chellaney is a geostrategist.\\n\\nThe views expressed are personal

       "The Indian Air Force is \"well prepared\" and \"suitably deployed\" to counter any security challenge along the border with China, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday as a deadly clash between troops of the countries in eastern Ladakh triggered fears of a fresh confrontation.\\n\\nHe said the IAF was aware of the Chinese air force's capability, its airfields, operational bases and deployment of its platforms in the region, asserting that his force has taken all necessary steps to handle all contingencies.\\n\\nThe Chief of Air Staff was speaking after reviewing the combined passing-out parade of officers at the IAF academy in Dundigal.\\n\\n\"We are aware of the full situation, be at LAC (Line of Actual Control), be it deployments beyond LAC,\" he said.\\n\\nâ€œWe are determined that we will not let the sacrifice of the Galwan bravehearts go in vain,â€� Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said referring to the killing of 20 Indian Army personnel in the Galwan Valley clash on Monday night.\\n\\nAt the same time, he said all efforts are being made to resolve the situation peacefully.\\n\\nThe Indian Air Force has put all its frontline bases along the 3,500 km de-facto border with China on high-alert and moved in additional assets like fighter jets and attack helicopters as part of heightened state of preparedness following the clashes.\\n\\nThe IAF chief was at the Leh IAF base on Wednesday where he reviewed operational preparedness of the force.\\n\\n\"It should be very clear that we are well prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency.

We know what their air fields are, where they are deployed, what are the operational bases,\" he said referring to the Chinese air force.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the government put all the frontline bases of the Indian Army and the IAF along the Line of Actual Control with China on high alert in view of the Galwan clashes.\\n\\nThough, every year China makes deployment and conducts air exercises in the region, there was an increase in activities this time, the IAF chief said.\\n\\n\"The security scenario in our region mandates that our armed forces remain prepared and vigilant at all times. The development at LAC is a small snapshot of what we are required to handle at short notice,\" he added.\\n\\nThe Indian and Chinese armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when the two sides clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.\\n\\nMilitary and diplomatic talks between the two countries are on to resolve the border standoff.

       "NEW DELHI: China once again on Wednesday claimed its sovereignty over the â€˜ Galwan Valley regionâ€™, asking India not to cross Galwan-Shyok estuary, even as talks were underway between foreign ministries of both sides to de-escalate the tension.In a twin attack against India, Chinese foreign and defence ministries slammed Delhi for violating â€œbilateral agreements, international rules and provoking the clashâ€� and blamed Delhi for June 15 incident.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing: â€œMy statement just now is meant to clarify the whole situation, tell the truth to everyone. We made the statement because the MEA in India and also Indian media have made some false reports.â€�Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said: â€œBut what is shocking is that on the evening of June 15, Indian front-line frontier troops openly violated the consensus reached by the two sides, turned their backs, and once again crossed the actual control line to deliberately provoke China. While negotiating on the spot, Chinese officers and soldiers were suddenly violently attacked by the Indian side. This triggered intense physical clashes between officers and soldiers on both sides, resulting in casualties.â€�The statements struck a jarring note for the 15th Meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) on India-China Border Affairs, which virtually agreed that peace at the LAC would contribute to the development of broader relationship between the two countries. WMCC also took note of the discussions in the second meeting of the senior commanders held on June 22, according to MEA statement. The two sides also agreed to maintain communication both at diplomatic and military levels, including under the framework of WMCC to resolve the existing situation peacefully. China, on its part said, there were free and frank discussions at WMCC.The two sides discussed in detail the developments in the border areas, in particular the situation in eastern Ladakh. The Indian side conveyed its concerns on the recent developments in eastern Ladakh, including on the violent faceoff at the Galwan Valley. In this regard, it was emphasised that both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC, according to the MEA statement.The bilateral agreements and protocols to maintain peace at Line of Actual Control include Sino-Indian boundary agreements of 1993 and 1996. The 1993 agreement states in case personnel from either side cross the LAC, â€œupon being cautioned by the other side, they shall immediately pull back to their side of the Line of Actual Controlâ€�. China has not done that either in Galwan or Pangong Tso. The PLA rather built structures and stationed its troops which can be considered troop build up.No activities of either side shall overstep the LAC. In case personnel of one side cross the LAC, upon being cautioned by the other side, they shall immediately pull back to their own side of the Line of Actual Control. When necessary, the two sides shall jointly check and determine the segments of the Line of Actual Control where they have different views as to its alignment,â€� according to the 1993 Agreement.Three years later both sides went into further specifics, making it clear that troops on both sides shall â€œexercise self-restraintâ€� in case of a face-off situation and start â€œimmediate consultationsâ€� through diplomatic channels.The 1996 agreement states, \"If the border personnel of the two sides come in a face-to-face situation due to differences on the alignment of the line of actual control or any other reason, they shall exercise self-restraint and take all necessary steps to avoid an escalation of the situation. Both sides shall also enter into immediate consultations through diplomatic and/or other available channels to review the situation and prevent any escalation of tension.\"The agreement, also for the first time in India-China rules of engagement, makes it clear that â€œneither side shall open fire or conduct blast operations within 2 km of the Line of Actual Controlâ€�. This is what led to a practice, where troops on both sides, never brandished weapons at each other and at most, indulged in a physical jostle.

      "The June 15 incident in the disputed Galwan Valley, an arid Himalayan area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between the two nations, left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China has yet to officially declare its casualties.\n",
      "\n",
      "More:\n",
      "\n",
      "Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in the standoff since early May at several points along the 3,500km (2,200-mile) LAC, most of which remains undemarcated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heightened tensions between the world's two most populous countries have drawn international concerns, with the United Nations urging both sides \"to exercise maximum restraint\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are five things you need to know about the dispute:\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened on June 15?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fighting on June 15 was triggered by a disagreement over two Chinese tents and observation towers that Indian officials said had been built on its side of the LAC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese troops breached the Line to set up temporary \"structures\" in the Galwan Valley even after military officials had reached an agreement on June 6 to de-escalate, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told China's senior diplomat, Wang Yi, in a phone call.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem arose when an Indian patrol visited the area near a ridge to verify a Chinese assertion that its troops had moved back from the LAC, two government sources told Reuters news agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese troops had thinned out, leaving behind two tents and small observation posts, which the Indian party demolished, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large group of Chinese soldiers arrived and confronted the Indian troops. It was not clear what happened next, but the two sides soon clashed, the Chinese soldiers reportedly using iron rods and batons with spikes, killing 20 Indian soldiers and wounding dozens of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "China has not said anything about any losses in the hand-to-hand combat.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, V K Singh, Indian federal minister for roads and transport and a former army chief, claimed China lost at least 40 soldiers in the clash, without providing any evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's state-controlled Global Times said there had been Chinese casualties, but did not elaborate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indian army convoy moves along the Srinagar-Leh National highway towards Ladakh [Faisal Khan/Anadolu]\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did the clash happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts mainly cite two reasons for the deadliest clash since 1975.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major reason, according to some experts, is linked to India's unilateral move last year to repeal Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which had guaranteed a measure of autonomy to the former Jammu and Kashmir state, which also included the disputed areas in Ladakh region.\n",
      "\n",
      "China, which, like Pakistan, saw India's move as unilaterally affecting its territory, strongly denounced the move at the UN Security Council last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts also believe the current standoff is also a result of China's pushback against India's recent construction of infrastructure in border areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "India inaugurated the 255km (158-mile) Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road, built along the LAC, last year. China objected, seeing the move as a threat to its interests in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's economic corridor to Pakistan and Central Asia passes through Karakoram, which is close to Galwan Valley, the site of the June 15 clash. Galwan Valley is close to Aksai Chin Plateau, which is under Chinese control but claimed by India.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Happymon Jacob, professor of international relations at New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University, China considers the Ladakh region crucial for its \"access to Central Asia and CPEC project with Pakistan in which they [China] have invested billions of dollars [about $60bn].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indian Border Security Force soldiers guard a highway leading towards Leh, bordering China, in Gagangir [Tauseef Mustafa/AFP]\n",
      "\n",
      "What is each side claiming?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he was unaware of the specifics but that the Indian army had crossed into Chinese territory in several places in recent days - violating the agreement reached on June 6 - and that they should withdraw.\n",
      "\n",

What remains to be seen is the impact that the tragic loss of lives will have on the future trajectory of the broader India-China relationship, how the ramifications will play out on the regional chessboard, and to what extent the rules of engagement at the LAC, which had been arduously worked out over years, would be diluted or transformed.â€�\\n\\nThe flare-up has forced the Centre to bump up its security measures along its borders, with the Indian Air Force beefing up its bases along the LAC in case the situation escalates.\\n\\nâ€œIt is unclear whether such aggression is meant to be a Chinese show of strength and intent in response to the international criticism and calls for accountability by several prominent members of the international community for its role in the origination and spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), or an effort to divert the attention of its growing number of disenchanted subjects struggling to cope with the steep economic downturn and uncertainty, or even opportunism in making the most of a weakened and inattentive United States (US) that is grappling with a severe COVID-19 outbreak and a divisive election campaign. What is, however, not at all ambiguous is that China has been testing the limits of international laws, conventions and norms, and the attack on the LAC was the latest and most serious manifestation,â€� the report claimed.\\n\\nThe body observed that the LAC attack led to Chinaâ€™s most serious security situation with India in recent years, and flared emotions have meant that the potential for rapid escalation is rife.\\n\\nâ€œAlthough experts seem unclear on what prompted China to believe that such volatility, which was the obvious outcome that could be anticipated from an attack such as the one that it launched at the LAC, would be in its interests, most seem to concur that the Chinese attack marks the 21st century turning point for India and China, and that the two countries face a future characterized by deepened distrust and potential fresh conflict,â€� they said.\\n\\nThe EFSAS further elaborated on Chinaâ€™s nefarious tactics to usurp territories in the South China Sea even after a global outcry over the strategic misadventure.\\n\\nâ€œThe attack on Indian troops comes on the back of an increasing Chinese assertiveness, be it in the South China Sea, Taiwan or Hong Kong. China has been flexing its muscle across the region, intercepting Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea, seizing new powers over Hong Kong and twice sailing an aircraft carrier through the sensitive Taiwan Strait,â€� the think tank said.\\n\\nThe Ministry of External Affairs on Saturday stated that Chinaâ€™s â€œuntenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control are not acceptableâ€� in wake of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijianâ€™s false claims earlier in the day that Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh is located on the Chinese side of the border. â€œWe expect that the Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the Foreign Ministers,â€� MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.'"
