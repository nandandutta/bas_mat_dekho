       "'Text Size: A- A+\\n\\nFour controversial issues associated with CAA have been seriously debated in Parliament and in public discussions. In order to understand the official positions and justification given by the [Narendra Modi] government on these issues, we examine the 2019 Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 (JPC Report). This report introduces us to those technical-legal points, which contribute to the political arguments of the ruling party.\\n\\nThe legal criterion for selecting the specific cases of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\\n\\nThe selection of three Muslim-majority countries to identify the persecuted non-Muslim minorities is the first critical question. The inclusion of Afghanistan in this list looks quite strange. Pakistan and Bangladesh were the outcome of the two partitions of the subcontinent in 1947 and 1971, which led to massive migration of population. These countries also share borders with India, which makes the question of illegal immigration politically relevant. However, the case of Afghanistan is different. It does not share borders with India and it did not have any direct political-historical continuity with the Indian republic.\\n\\nAlthough the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)did not spell out its legal criterion for selecting three specific cases, the official response revolved around the idea of religious persecution of religious minorities in these Muslim countries. This justification was also invoked to rationalize the inclusion of Afghanistan in this list. The JPC report clarified that â€�a number of persons belonging to minority communities in Afghanistan have also come to India on account of religious persecution or fear of religious persecution. Hence, it was decided to include Afghanistanâ€™ in the ambit. This religious persecution of non-Muslims was also seen in relation to the wider Indian interest in Afghanistan, as the report asserted that â€œthere have been multiple attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan by the Pakistanâ€¦sponsored LET, Haqqani Network and Talibanâ€™, henceâ€¦minority communities are facing â€¦atrocities due to their Indian originâ€�.\\n\\nThe MHA, however, underlined that it did not ignore the plight of minorities in other neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The report emphasised that the government followed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) since 2011 for dealing with foreign nationals. The SPO, therefore, was a legal procedure available to all refugees in India, allowing them to reside in India as legal immigrant. These individuals may apply for Indian citizenship as per the rules spelt out in the Citizenship Act 1955.\\n\\nIn other words, there are six non-Muslim religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians) of three Muslim countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan)who areseparated from the others migrants. However, these six minorities do not become Indian citizens only on the basis of religious persecution. The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law notes that the CAA â€œdoes not directly confer citizenship on these persons (â€¦) it merely provides (â€¦) the opportunity to be considered for the grant of certificate of naturalisationâ€�.\\n\\nThe CAA enables the illegal migrants belonging to six specified communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian Citizenship in two categories, Registration [Section 5 (1) (a)] and Naturalisation (Section 6). For this purpose, the Third Schedule of 1955 Act was also amended to reduce the residence requirement from eleven to five years. It simply means that the six non-Muslim minorities are given a particular kind of relaxation under the CAA.\\n\\nAlso read: Modi is sailing smooth now, but history wonâ€™t be kind to him\\n\\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions.

SUBSCRIBE NOW\\n\\nThe idea of minority\\n\\nThe CAA 2019 does not use the term â€œminorityâ€�. Instead, it identifies six-non-Muslim communities. The naming of communities on religious basis actually goes against the established Constitution principles. The Constitution introduces terms such as minority, Schedule Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) as secular administrative categories. For instance, if a social group is culturally/religiously/linguistically distinct and numerically inferior, it might be recognised as a â€œminorityâ€�.\\n\\nIf a social group had experienced caste discrimination and/or untouchability in the past, it would be included in the â€˜Scheduled Castesâ€™ list. And, indigenous communities or tribes are to be officially recognised as â€˜Scheduled Tribesâ€™. Since minority, SCs, and STs (and later the Other Backward Classes, the OBCs) are conceived as open, secular, administrative templates, no social group, technically speaking, would become a permanent constituent of these official-secular classifications.\\n\\nThe JPC report also highlights this point. In fact, a constitutional expert criticised the CAA for not using the expression minority, arguing that:\\n\\nIf you want to be on the safer side, we would have to omit reference to religions like Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis etc. (â€¦) if we use the term â€˜persecuted minoritiesâ€™ the purpose would be served. As compared to communities, minorities would perhaps be more useful from the legal and constitutional point of view.\\n\\nThe Legislative Department, however, did not subscribe to this view and justified the use of religious categories:\\n\\nUsing persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries instead of its current form may negate the objectives of the Bill. As there is a possibility for wider scope of interpretation, it may be construed to include other communities (religious or otherwise). Moreover, the aspect of â€˜religious persecutionâ€™ would also be lost sight of.\\n\\nIt is obvious here that the official purpose of the CAA is to provide legitimacy to the idea of religious persecution. Interestingly, however, the term religious persecution is not included in the final text of the CAA, 2019. This strategic lapse requires some explanation. The process to enact the CAA, we must remember, began with an official notification issued in 2015. The six non-Muslim communities were given visa relaxation by amending the Visa rules. The term religious persecution was invoked in this notification as a legal plea in defense of the amendment.\\n\\nThe MHA and the Legislative Department forcefully argued that the CAA was based on the gazette notification of 2015, hence there was no need to use the term religious persecution in the text of CAA. The JPC accepted this rather vague explanation and did not ask a crucial follow-up question: if religious persecution could be used in an official administrative order as a legal plea, why couldnâ€™t it be accommodated in the text of the bill presented for legislative scrutiny?\\n\\nAlso read: 93% Muslims view Hindus favourably, but only 65% Hindus view Muslims positively: Pew survey\\n\\nExclusion of Muslims\\n\\nThe CAA excludes Muslims in two ways. It highlights the persecution of non-Muslims in neighbouring Muslim countries and, at the same time, does not include Muslims in the list of preferred migrants. This exclusion is seen as a violation of Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 25 (Freedom of religion). The JPC also raised this question. The Legislative Department, however, made two broad arguments in defence of the constitutional validity of the CAA. First, it said the law was justified on the basis of a legal doctrine called reasonable classification.\\n\\nAccording to this doctrine, if there is a special law that is applicable only to a certain sections/groups, the court is entitled to â€˜enquire whether the classification is founded on a reasonable basisâ€¦or is arbitraryâ€™ (Emphasis added). The reasonableness of classification, in this sense, can only be questioned if a law violates the rights of other persons/communities, which are outside the scope of its legal ambit. The classification of migrants into persecuted minorities and others, by this logic, is called reasonable because it does not affect the rights of Muslim citizens in India.\\n\\nSecond, the Legislative Department said the CAA was also justified on the basis of freedom of religion (Art 25). It argued that this law aims to protect the religious rights of persecuted minorities seeking Indian citizenship. At the same time, it does not have any impact on the right to worship and religion of other Indian citizens, including Muslims. This line of reasoning actually finds a clear political overtone in the speeches of BJP leaders.\\n\\nThis legal defence of the CAA as a special law becomes unconvincing when it is read in relation to NCR and NPR. As already explained, NCR and NPR are inseparable constituents of the established legal framework of Indian citizenship. The classification of usual residents into citizens and doubtful persons gets a radically different interpretation after the enactment of the CAA. It is important to remember that unlike the NPR 2010 exercise, NPR 2020 aims to collect additional data such as Aadhaar card number and parentsâ€™ birthplace. It is mandatory for the usual residents to provide this information. However, if a resident fails to submit sufficient documents to the NPR officials, including the proof that his/her parents were/are Indian citizens, his/her citizenship may become doubtful. He/she would be listed in the â€˜Dâ€™ category of the proposed NRC.\\n\\nThe government has not yet evolved any mechanism to deal with such cases. The CAA offers a clear cut answer to these ambiguities. It is easier for a doubtful Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian person/resident to apply for Indian citizenship even if he/she does not have sufficient documents. He/she may justify his/her application by citing the term religious persecution. However, a doubtful Muslim would eventually be treated as a foreigner as he/she is excluded from the list.\\n\\nAlthough Prime Minister Modi categorically denied any relationship between CAA and the NRC-NPR, Home Minister Amit Shah explained the CAA-NRC-NPR chronology in his various speeches and interviews. He said:\\n\\nfirst we will pass the Citizenship Amendment bill and ensure that all the refugees from the neighbouring nations get the Indian citizenship. After that, NRC will be made and we will detect and deport every infiltrator from our motherland.\\n\\nIn another interview, he clarified that the purpose of the CAA and NRC was to deal with the problem of infiltrators at the national level:\\n\\nall the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christians, they will get citizenship (â€¦) We want to walk up to them and give them citizenship. They wouldnâ€™t be asked for any documents\\n\\nShahâ€™s political explanation of the CAA-NRC-NPR actually goes against the legal-technical arguments presented by the MHA to JPC. In the backdrop of this apparent political clarification, the legal reasonableness invoked by the MHA to defend CAA (as a special law that deals with a special group of peopleâ€”persecuted minority) becomes completely irrelevant.\\n\\nAlso read: Assamâ€™s old 1970s fury back with Citizenship Act. This time for a new, young generation\\n\\nThe relationship between the Assam Accord and the CAA\\n\\nAs pointed out earlier, the Assam Accord has been an important political phenomenon that redefines the contours of citizenship framework in India. The CAA, broadly speaking, goes against the spirit of the Assam Accord in two ways: it modifies the cut-off date from 1971 to 2014; and at the same time, makes a distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim migrants. These changes offer an opportunity to non-Muslim migrants of Bangladesh to apply for Indian citizenship even if they had entered the state of Assam after 1971. The JPC, it appears, dealt with this issue delicately and asked the government to respect the sentiments of the people of Assam and the North-east:\\n\\nThe Committee feel that in view of the anxieties and concerns expressed by the civil society groups in Assam and other North-Eastern States, the State and Central Governments should formulate rules and regulations under this Clause (6A) to ensure that the identities of indigenous peoples are not threatened in any way by unintended consequences of the Citizenship Bill.\\n\\nThe final version of the CAA, it seems, accommodated these suggestions. Section 3(4) of the new Law makes it clear that the changes introduced by the new amendment will not apply to â€˜tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripuraâ€¦and the area covered under The Inner Lineâ€™.\\n\\nThis edited excerpt has been published with the permission of The French Institute of International Relations.

       "'Text Size: A- A+\\n\\nFour controversial issues associated with CAA have been seriously debated in Parliament and in public discussions. In order to understand the official positions and justification given by the [Narendra Modi] government on these issues, we examine the 2019 Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 (JPC Report). This report introduces us to those technical-legal points, which contribute to the political arguments of the ruling party.\\n\\nThe legal criterion for selecting the specific cases of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan\\n\\nThe selection of three Muslim-majority countries to identify the persecuted non-Muslim minorities is the first critical question. The inclusion of Afghanistan in this list looks quite strange. Pakistan and Bangladesh were the outcome of the two partitions of the subcontinent in 1947 and 1971, which led to massive migration of population. These countries also share borders with India, which makes the question of illegal immigration politically relevant. However, the case of Afghanistan is different. It does not share borders with India and it did not have any direct political-historical continuity with the Indian republic.\\n\\nAlthough the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)did not spell out its legal criterion for selecting three specific cases, the official response revolved around the idea of religious persecution of religious minorities in these Muslim countries. This justification was also invoked to rationalize the inclusion of Afghanistan in this list. The JPC report clarified that â€�a number of persons belonging to minority communities in Afghanistan have also come to India on account of religious persecution or fear of religious persecution. Hence, it was decided to include Afghanistanâ€™ in the ambit. This religious persecution of non-Muslims was also seen in relation to the wider Indian interest in Afghanistan, as the report asserted that â€œthere have been multiple attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan by the Pakistanâ€¦sponsored LET, Haqqani Network and Talibanâ€™, henceâ€¦minority communities are facing â€¦atrocities due to their Indian originâ€�.\\n\\nThe MHA, however, underlined that it did not ignore the plight of minorities in other neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The report emphasised that the government followed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) since 2011 for dealing with foreign nationals. The SPO, therefore, was a legal procedure available to all refugees in India, allowing them to reside in India as legal immigrant. These individuals may apply for Indian citizenship as per the rules spelt out in the Citizenship Act 1955.\\n\\nIn other words, there are six non-Muslim religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians) of three Muslim countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan)who areseparated from the others migrants. However, these six minorities do not become Indian citizens only on the basis of religious persecution. The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law notes that the CAA â€œdoes not directly confer citizenship on these persons (â€¦) it merely provides (â€¦) the opportunity to be considered for the grant of certificate of naturalisationâ€�.\\n\\nThe CAA enables the illegal migrants belonging to six specified communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian Citizenship in two categories, Registration [Section 5 (1) (a)] and Naturalisation (Section 6). For this purpose, the Third Schedule of 1955 Act was also amended to reduce the residence requirement from eleven to five years. It simply means that the six non-Muslim minorities are given a particular kind of relaxation under the CAA.\\n\\nAlso read: Modi is sailing smooth now, but history wonâ€™t be kind to him\\n\\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions. Quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. Your support will define our work and ThePrintâ€™s future. SUBSCRIBE NOW\\n\\nThe idea of minority\\n\\nThe CAA 2019 does not use the term â€œminorityâ€�. Instead, it identifies six-non-Muslim communities. The naming of communities on religious basis actually goes against the established Constitution principles. The Constitution introduces terms such as minority, Schedule Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) as secular administrative categories. For instance, if a social group is culturally/religiously/linguistically distinct and numerically inferior, it might be recognised as a â€œminorityâ€�.\\n\\nIf a social group had experienced caste discrimination and/or untouchability in the past, it would be included in the â€˜Scheduled Castesâ€™ list. And, indigenous communities or tribes are to be officially recognised as â€˜Scheduled Tribesâ€™. Since minority, SCs, and STs (and later the Other Backward Classes, the OBCs) are conceived as open, secular, administrative templates, no social group, technically speaking, would become a permanent constituent of these official-secular classifications.\\n\\nThe JPC report also highlights this point. In fact, a constitutional expert criticised the CAA for not using the expression minority, arguing that:\\n\\nIf you want to be on the safer side, we would have to omit reference to religions like Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis etc. (â€¦) if we use the term â€˜persecuted minoritiesâ€™ the purpose would be served. As compared to communities, minorities would perhaps be more useful from the legal and constitutional point of view.\\n\\nThe Legislative Department, however, did not subscribe to this view and justified the use of religious categories:\\n\\nUsing persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries instead of its current form may negate the objectives of the Bill. As there is a possibility for wider scope of interpretation, it may be construed to include other communities (religious or otherwise). Moreover, the aspect of â€˜religious persecutionâ€™ would also be lost sight of.\\n\\nIt is obvious here that the official purpose of the CAA is to provide legitimacy to the idea of religious persecution. Interestingly, however, the term religious persecution is not included in the final text of the CAA, 2019. This strategic lapse requires some explanation. The process to enact the CAA, we must remember, began with an official notification issued in 2015. The six non-Muslim communities were given visa relaxation by amending the Visa rules. The term religious persecution was invoked in this notification as a legal plea in defense of the amendment.\\n\\nThe MHA and the Legislative Department forcefully argued that the CAA was based on the gazette notification of 2015, hence there was no need to use the term religious persecution in the text of CAA. The JPC accepted this rather vague explanation and did not ask a crucial follow-up question: if religious persecution could be used in an official administrative order as a legal plea, why couldnâ€™t it be accommodated in the text of the bill presented for legislative scrutiny?\\n\\nAlso read: 93% Muslims view Hindus favourably, but only 65% Hindus view Muslims positively: Pew survey\\n\\nExclusion of Muslims\\n\\nThe CAA excludes Muslims in two ways. It highlights the persecution of non-Muslims in neighbouring Muslim countries and, at the same time, does not include Muslims in the list of preferred migrants. This exclusion is seen as a violation of Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 25 (Freedom of religion). The JPC also raised this question. The Legislative Department, however, made two broad arguments in defence of the constitutional validity of the CAA. First, it said the law was justified on the basis of a legal doctrine called reasonable classification.\\n\\nAccording to this doctrine, if there is a special law that is applicable only to a certain sections/groups, the court is entitled to â€˜enquire whether the classification is founded on a reasonable basisâ€¦or is arbitraryâ€™ (Emphasis added). The reasonableness of classification, in this sense, can only be questioned if a law violates the rights of other persons/communities, which are outside the scope of its legal ambit. The classification of migrants into persecuted minorities and others, by this logic, is called reasonable because it does not affect the rights of Muslim citizens in India.\\n\\nSecond, the Legislative Department said the CAA was also justified on the basis of freedom of religion (Art 25). It argued that this law aims to protect the religious rights of persecuted minorities seeking Indian citizenship. At the same time, it does not have any impact on the right to worship and religion of other Indian citizens, including Muslims. This line of reasoning actually finds a clear political overtone in the speeches of BJP leaders.\\n\\nThis legal defence of the CAA as a special law becomes unconvincing when it is read in relation to NCR and NPR. As already explained, NCR and NPR are inseparable constituents of the established legal framework of Indian citizenship. The classification of usual residents into citizens and doubtful persons gets a radically different interpretation after the enactment of the CAA. It is important to remember that unlike the NPR 2010 exercise, NPR 2020 aims to collect additional data such as Aadhaar card number and parentsâ€™ birthplace. It is mandatory for the usual residents to provide this information. However, if a resident fails to submit sufficient documents to the NPR officials, including the proof that his/her parents were/are Indian citizens, his/her citizenship may become doubtful. He/she would be listed in the â€˜Dâ€™ category of the proposed NRC.\\n\\nThe government has not yet evolved any mechanism to deal with such cases. The CAA offers a clear cut answer to these ambiguities. It is easier for a doubtful Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian person/resident to apply for Indian citizenship even if he/she does not have sufficient documents. He/she may justify his/her application by citing the term religious persecution. However, a doubtful Muslim would eventually be treated as a foreigner as he/she is excluded from the list.\\n\\nAlthough Prime Minister Modi categorically denied any relationship between CAA and the NRC-NPR, Home Minister Amit Shah explained the CAA-NRC-NPR chronology in his various speeches and interviews. He said:\\n\\nfirst we will pass the Citizenship Amendment bill and ensure that all the refugees from the neighbouring nations get the Indian citizenship. After that, NRC will be made and we will detect and deport every infiltrator from our motherland.\\n\\nIn another interview, he clarified that the purpose of the CAA and NRC was to deal with the problem of infiltrators at the national level:\\n\\nall the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christians, they will get citizenship (â€¦) We want to walk up to them and give them citizenship. They wouldnâ€™t be asked for any documents\\n\\nShahâ€™s political explanation of the CAA-NRC-NPR actually goes against the legal-technical arguments presented by the MHA to JPC. In the backdrop of this apparent political clarification, the legal reasonableness invoked by the MHA to defend CAA (as a special law that deals with a special group of peopleâ€”persecuted minority) becomes completely irrelevant.\\n\\nAlso read: Assamâ€™s old 1970s fury back with Citizenship Act. This time for a new, young generation\\n\\nThe relationship between the Assam Accord and the CAA\\n\\nAs pointed out earlier, the Assam Accord has been an important political phenomenon that redefines the contours of citizenship framework in India. The CAA, broadly speaking, goes against the spirit of the Assam Accord in two ways: it modifies the cut-off date from 1971 to 2014; and at the same time, makes a distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim migrants. These changes offer an opportunity to non-Muslim migrants of Bangladesh to apply for Indian citizenship even if they had entered the state of Assam after 1971. The JPC, it appears, dealt with this issue delicately and asked the government to respect the sentiments of the people of Assam and the North-east:\\n\\nThe Committee feel that in view of the anxieties and concerns expressed by the civil society groups in Assam and other North-Eastern States, the State and Central Governments should formulate rules and regulations under this Clause (6A) to ensure that the identities of indigenous peoples are not threatened in any way by unintended consequences of the Citizenship Bill.\\n\\nThe final version of the CAA, it seems, accommodated these suggestions. Section 3(4) of the new Law makes it clear that the changes introduced by the new amendment will not apply to â€˜tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripuraâ€¦and the area covered under The Inner Lineâ€™.\\n\\nThis edited excerpt has been published with the permission of The French Institute of International Relations.

      "The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, passed into law by Indiaâ€™s federal parliament in December 2019, proved to be a highly controversial move. In a nutshell, this legal move, usually referred to as the CAA for short, offers citizenship for persons who came to India from one of the following three neighboring countries while fleeing persecution: Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, citizenship can be granted provided that they had arrived by December 31, 2014, and that they are of any other religious community in those countries apart from the Muslim one. This last caveat caused large-scale protests in the country and condemnation outside its borders. As half a year has passed since the CAA was voted through, it is now time for a reckoning: did the law affect New Delhiâ€™s international position?\n",
      "\n",
      "In my commentary published for the Indian think-tank, Observer Research Foundation, I argued that another contentious issue â€“ Indiaâ€™s ruling partyâ€™s recent policies on Kashmir â€“ had hurt New Delhiâ€™s international image, but not its real position in the world. The same conclusion, I believe, generally stands true for the CAA controversy as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has any nation, bank, or company cancelled any economic deals with New Delhi because of CAA? Not to my knowledge. Have any sanctions been thrown at India? No. Has any country used military force, even by proxy, in reaction to New Delhiâ€™s passing of the controversial law? Again, the answer is no, as Pakistan-connected entities had been active in India long before December 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Islamabad unsurprisingly criticized the Indian governmentâ€™s move in strong words. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan suggested that the CAAâ€™s passing may even lead to a conflict between the two countries. Yet, given that the relations between the two countries are constantly strained, such saber-rattling rhetoric came neither as surprising nor as a change to the overall international equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful summary of various critical voices, published for The Diplomat by an Indian expert, Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, shows that the Indian governmentâ€™s image in the world did indeed take a beating. Yet, most of these acts of condemnation remained in the realm of diplomatic rhetoric or discussions on human rights. These reactions included censure from certain Islamic nations, such as Indonesia and Iran, and an announcement from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) that it was planning to â€œfile an application on the CAA in the Indian Supreme Court.â€�\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also diplomatic spats between India and Bangladesh, particularly after insensitive comments by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. These, as pointed out by Amit Ranjan for the The Diplomat, led to the cancellation and postponement of certain visits and talks, but so far no other major effect is apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the three neighbors, the migrants from which will be affected by CAA, New Delhi has enjoyed friendliest relations with Afghanistan (ever since 2001). Thus, displeasure over the new legal act in this country should be worrying for India. Even ex-president Hamid Karzai, known to be particularly close to India, asked the New Delhi government â€œto treat all Afghans equallyâ€� (as most of the nationâ€™s citizens are Muslims). Still, there is no evidence that the controversy pulled Afghanistan-India relations downward. Given the scale of New Delhiâ€™s past assistance to Afghanistan (a subject I summarized here) and the image India enjoys in that country, it is possible that CAA will not cause large-scale diplomatic conflict with Kabul.\n",
      "\n",
      "United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells voiced careful concern about CAA just after she came back from the Raisina Dialogue, held in New Delhi in January 2020 (in her briefing before the State Department). This did not stop U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s visit India nearly a month later, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of April, the United States Commission on International Religious suggested in a new report that the U.S. government should designate India a â€œcountry of particular concernâ€� and even impose sanctions on Indian â€œagencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedom by freezing those individualsâ€™ assets and or barring their entry into the United States.â€� The CAA was the primary, though not the only, reason given by the commission to justify this view. Yet, this did not mean that its conclusions reflected Washingtonâ€™s official position. It is improbable that the United States will decide to introduce such sanctions at a time of a fast-growing India-U.S. partnership, especially given that the â€œagencies and officialsâ€� responsible for the CAA would include some of Indiaâ€™s most influential politicians and most significant ministries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the European Union, various groups of parties introduced their draft resolutions in the European Parliament, all of which criticized the CAA to various degrees. Elements of few resolutions were then condensed into one draft resolution. Further moves signaled that the EU did not want to put its ties with India in peril for the sake of this issue, however. At the end of January, it was decided that the EU Parliamentâ€™s vote on the resolution was to be postponed until late March, effectively moving it after the planned EU-India summit (which subsequently was also postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has not taken place till the time of writing). Moreover, as noticed by Geeta Mohan for India Today, the EUâ€™s Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stressed that the proposed resolutions were â€œonly drafts tabled by various political groups,â€� and not the official position of the European Union as such.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be added, however, that the issue of CAA is connected to another contentious legal decision: the gradual introduction of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India. Since in the previous decades the largest influx of people to India came from Bangladesh, the realization of both CAA and NRC would have to mean that many Bangladeshi nationals will be deported. This issue may thus affect New Delhiâ€™s ties with Dhaka in the future.\n"
