(AP Photo/John Locher)\\n\\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” Between 10% and 20% of U.S. coronavirus cases are health care workers, though they tended to be hospitalized at lower rates than other patients, officials reported Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first national data on how the pandemic is hitting doctors, nurses and other health care professionals.\\n\\nThe data is important new information but not necessarily surprising, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, who is running the federal agencyâ€™s response to the outbreak. Medical staff have also been hit hard in other countries, including Italy and Spain.\\n\\nAs of the middle of last week, the CDC had reports of more than 315,000 cases in the U.S. The new report focused on about 49,000 for which researchers had data on whether or not they worked in health care. About 9,300, or 19%, of them were medical professionals. That included 27 who died.\\n\\nBut the data varied in how complete it was, researchers said. In 12 states that did a better job reporting on whether patients worked in medicine, around 11% of cases were health care workers.\\n\\nCompared with U.S. cases overall, larger proportions of diagnosed health care workers were women, were white, and were young or middle-aged adults. Thatâ€™s consistent with the demographics of who works in health care, researchers said.\\n\\nAbout 10% of the health care workers were hospitalized with symptoms, compared with 21% to 31% of overall cases. That may reflect the younger age of the workers, as well as prioritization of testing for health care employees, the report said.\\n\\nSlightly more than half of a group of infected health care workers studied said their only known exposure to the virus was at work, but researchers say itâ€™s hard to know for sure how different people caught the bug.\\n\\nA second report released Tuesday looked at three health care workers who became infected after treating a patient in Solano County, California, in what was one of the first instances of disease spread to medical personnel in the U.S. Workers didnâ€™t initially know the patient was infected with the coronavirus. All three did not wear eye protection or some other forms of protective equipment at least part of the time they were caring for the person, researchers said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Instituteâ€™s Department of Science Education.

The first 2,500 units are to arrive before the end of May, HHS said, and the rest by the end of December.\\n\\nPhilips refused to say which model of ventilator the government was buying. But in response to questions from ProPublica, HHS officials said the government is purchasing the Trilogy EV300, the more expensive version of the ventilator that was developed with federal funds.\\n\\nHelp Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\\n\\nThe deal is a striking departure from the federal contract Philipsâ€™ Respironics division signed in September to produce 10,000 ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile at a cost of $3,280 each.\\n\\nâ€œThis kind of profiteering â€” paying four times the negotiated price â€” is not only irresponsible to taxpayers but is particularly offensive when so many people are out of work,â€� said Dr. Nicole Lurie, who served as the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the Obama administration. â€œAnd besides, most of these ventilators will come too late to make a difference in this pandemic. Weâ€™ll then â€™replenishâ€™ the stockpile at a ridiculously high price.â€�\\n\\nâ€œWhat else,â€� she asked, â€œwonâ€™t we be able to buy as a result?â€�\\n\\nIn an article March 30, ProPublica detailed how the agencyâ€™s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, had anticipated a decade ago that hospitals would run short of life-saving ventilators in the event of a pandemic. BARDA tried to find a company that could produce an inexpensive, durable ventilator that could be operated by people with minimal training during a crisis. After a deal with one company fell apart, HHS in 2014 agreed to pay Philips $13.8 million to design the stockpile ventilator with an option to purchase 10,000 for $3,280 each. The company won Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator in July, and in September HHS put in its order.\\n\\nRead More Taxpayers Paid Millions to Design a Low-Cost Ventilator for a Pandemic. Instead, the Company Is Selling Versions of It Overseas. As coronavirus sweeps the globe, there is not a single Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator â€” developed with government funds â€” in the U.S. stockpile. Meanwhile, Royal Philips N.V. has sold higher-priced versions to clients around the world.\\n\\nBut Philips didnâ€™t deliver any ventilators to the stockpile even as the coronavirus spread across the globe and hospitals scrambled for ventilators to keep their patients alive. Rather than making the government-funded design, Philips has been manufacturing more expensive commercial versions of the Trilogy Evo at its Pennsylvania plant and selling them overseas and in the United States.\\n\\nPhilips said it was within its rights to sell the commercial versions first because its contract with HHS gave the company until 2022 to produce the cheaper stockpile version. Philips had only made the stockpile version in small batches and didnâ€™t want to ramp up production on a ventilator that it hadnâ€™t mass produced, a slower process than increasing production of other models, company spokesman Steve Klink explained last month. He also said the government contract did not cover all of the costs for the ventilatorsâ€™ development.\\n\\nNow the company wonâ€™t have to try. The Philips contract announced Wednesday is for the commercial version, the Trilogy EV300, with the government paying $15,039 each.\\n\\nThe HHS statement said the agency purchased â€œwhat was immediately availableâ€� under â€œnegotiated pricingâ€� with Philips. President Donald Trump directed HHS Secretary Alex Azar to invoke the Defense Production Act in brokering the deal, the statement said.\\n\\nThe government still expects Philips to produce the 10,000 stockpile versions of the ventilator, but no completion date was given in the statement.\\n\\nLurie was in charge of the HHS office that struck the 2014 deal with Philips. During her time, congressional Republicans elected on a Tea Party wave forced cuts in federal spending that hampered efforts to bulk up the stockpile. The goal of the Philips deal, Lurie said, was to produce a low-cost, easy-to-use ventilator and use the stockpileâ€™s budget responsibly. But it was also an effort to show the industry that low-cost ventilators were feasible.\\n\\nâ€œThis was a strategy to reduce health care costs,â€� Lurie said. â€œThis feels like a conspiracy to keep them high.â€�\\n\\nIn a news release touting the deal on Wednesday, Philips said that it has been ramping up production and this year has delivered several thousand ventilators to U.S. hospitals â€” including one in hard-hit New York City. The company, which only makes ventilators in the U.S., said it wanted to continue selling ventilators to other countries in need. Klink declined to comment further.\\n\\nJohn Hick, an emergency medicine specialist in Minneapolis who has advised HHS on pandemic response, said it would have been better to have a simpler and cheaper ventilator on hand.\\n\\nâ€œDonâ€™t get me wrong, I am happy they are getting ventilators,â€� he said. â€œIf you could buy four times as many for the price, why wouldnâ€™t you do that?â€�\\n\\nHick hopes that federal officials will learn a lesson from the Philips deal.\\n\\nâ€œWe have lost a lot of time,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s kind of like telling someone we are going to hurricane-proof your house after the hurricane has hit.â€�\\n\\nTell Us More About Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

       " 'Human trials will begin imminently â€“ but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible\\n\\nEven at their most effective â€“ and draconian â€“ containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.\\n\\nAbout 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these â€“ produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna â€“ will enter human trials imminently.\\n\\nThis unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.\\n\\nBut there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus â€“ flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk â€“ vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on â€œprototypeâ€� pathogens. â€œThe speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,â€� says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.\\n\\nCoronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics â€“ severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.\\n\\nSars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars â€“ hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung â€“ the same type of receptor in both cases â€“ allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cellâ€™s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.\\n\\nAll vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.\\n\\nTraditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy â€“ the one that Novavax is using, for example â€“ constructs a â€œrecombinantâ€� vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast â€“ forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another company which has a presence in Boston, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.\\n\\nCepiâ€™s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (Â£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. â€œOur experience with vaccine development is that you canâ€™t anticipate where youâ€™re going to stumble,â€� says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.\\n\\nClinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But thereâ€™s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. â€œNot all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,â€� says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.\\n\\nThere are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or theyâ€™re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials canâ€™t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material â€“ RNA or DNA â€“ has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: â€œWhile there is a push to do things as fast as possible, itâ€™s really important not to take shortcuts.â€�\\n\\nAn illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.\\n\\nItâ€™s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November â€“ an impossible deadline. â€œLike most vaccinologists, I donâ€™t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,â€� says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Thatâ€™s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.\\n\\nIn the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, itâ€™s going to be needed in vast quantities â€“ and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply donâ€™t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you donâ€™t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.\\n\\nOnce a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. â€œGetting a vaccine thatâ€™s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to whatâ€™s needed for a global immunisation programme,â€� says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). â€œVirus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.â€�\\n\\nThe problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk â€“ including children and pregnant women â€“ with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.\\n\\nBecause pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India â€“ a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world â€“ not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.\\n\\nOutside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes â€“ leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: â€œThe question is, what will happen in a situation where youâ€™ve got national emergencies going on?â€�\\n\\nThis is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, â€œwill probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is availableâ€�. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating â€“ like flu â€“ and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 19 March 2020.

       " 'Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Carly Fuglei was with a group of Danish friends in Beirut last month when she first considered moving back to the United States. They were preparing to leave Lebanon amid fears of a major coronavirus outbreak there, and tried to convince her to do the same.\\n\\nBut the 28-year-old humanitarian consultant from Montana decided to stay. After Lebanon closed its borders on March 19 to stem the spread of the global pandemic, she began furnishing her rooftop terrace. Her time in Beirut, she realized, would be indefinite.\\n\\n\"I made that decision for a combination of personal reasons and calculations about the virus that we\\'re all making,\" says Fuglei. \"I think that I am probably safer here.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a decision that several US citizens in Beirut who CNN spoke to have echoed, citing skyrocketing cases in the US . When the US government last week said it would fly its citizens and permanent residents to the US on a chartered flight for $2,500 per person, some Americans took to Twitter to publicly decline the offer.\\n\\n\"And no, Mom, I\\'m not going,\" Beirut-based freelance journalist Abby Sewell wrote in a tweet about the US embassy announcement.\\n\\nResponding to her tweet, a Lebanese journalist said: \"For once I\\'m like no America is not safer than here.\" Sewell\\'s mother, Meg Sewell, replied: \"Actually, for the moment I might have to agree.\"\\n\\nSewell tells CNN she never considered taking the US embassy\\'s offer.\\n\\n\"From everything I\\'m reading, the situation is worse in the US, in terms of the number of cases, prevention measures or lack thereof, and how overburdened the health system is,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Also, since I\\'ve been living overseas for years, I don\\'t have health insurance in the US now, so if I did go back and then got sick, I would be looking at paying thousands of dollars out of pocket.\"\\n\\nLebanese soldiers, wearing protective equipment, stand guard at Beirut international airport on April 5, ahead of the arrival of returning nationals.\\n\\nOn the morning of April 5, the US embassy flew 95 US citizens out of Lebanon, according to a US State Department official. It is estimated that thousands of Americans live in Lebanon -- many of whom also hold Lebanese citizenship.\\n\\n\"The Department of State has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,\" the official told CNN. \"We are rising to meet the historic challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, every day, all over the world.\"\\n\\nWhen asked about Americans suggesting that Beirut is, for once, safer than the US, the official declined to comment.\\n\\nA rapid outbreak back home\\n\\nDaryn Howland, 27, is hunkered down in her Beirut apartment, diving into her work as a consultant. \"My plan is to stay here for the indefinite future,\" says the Boston native.\\n\\n\"The fact that things are so bad in the US means it\\'s one of the first times where it\\'s safer to be in Lebanon than in the US,\" Howland also echoes. \"Despite the (Lebanese political and economic) situation ... I think my odds are better here.\"\\n\\n\"All of my American friends here have decided to stay,\" she adds.\\n\\nWhen the first novel coronavirus case was reported in Lebanon on February 21, the country was already awash with crises.\\n\\nNationwide protests erupted against the country\\'s political elite last October, toppling the government of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and deepening a political crisis. Already under increasing pressure, the country\\'s currency tanked. Last month, Beirut announced its first ever debt default.\\n\\nUnder widespread pressure from activists and media, the freshly-minted government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed not to take any chances with the virus, despite the toll any measures might take on the already troubled economy.\\n\\nSanitary workers disinfect the desks and chairs of the Lebanese Parliament on March 10.\\n\\nEight days after that first case, on February 29, the country closed its schools and universities. On March 6, it shuttered restaurants and cafes, ahead of several western European countries, such as Italy, in enforcing such a measure. The government then announced a lockdown on March 15.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the spread of the coronavirus in Lebanon has slowed, according to the World Health Organization\\'s Lebanon office. Medical professionals have offered cautious praise for the country\\'s relatively early steps to enforce the lockdown.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not at a stage where we have to decide who gets a ventilator and who doesn\\'t. That is because we are staying at home and the borders are closed,\" tweeted Dr. Firass Abiad, head of the government\\'s Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which has been dealing with the majority of coronavirus cases in Beirut. His tweet linked to a New York Times opinion piece about ventilator shortages in the US.\\n\\nAs of April 9, there are more than 430,000 Covid-19 cases and 14,000 deaths in the US, with 576 cases and 19 fatalities in Lebanon, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.\\n\\nJust under 12,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out so far in Lebanon. That equates to around 0.1% of the population (by contrast, roughly 0.3% of the population in Britain, and 1.1% of the population of Germany have been tested). As a result, the ministry of public health believes it is underestimating the scale of its outbreak. It has urged more people to get tested.\\n\\nLebanon\\'s ministry of public health has vowed to boost the number of screenings to as many as 2,000 a day. It says anyone with mild to severe symptoms is entitled to be tested.\\n\\nIn a recent video address, Director General of the Public Health Ministry Walid Ammar blamed the social stigma around COVID-19 for low levels of screening in the country: \"If a citizen feels that your reaction will be bad, then they won\\'t go and get tested,\" said Ammar. \"You all should be afraid of people who won\\'t get tested because they\\'re afraid of you. These are the people who will infect you.\"\\n\\nMore people are showing up for tests, but the medical sector -- which was dealt a heavy blow by the country\\'s financial crisis -- lacks the resources to conduct mass screenings, medical professionals say.\\n\\nMedics say that the country\\'s proactive lockdown measures have helped the health sector avoid the pandemonium seen in many other countries ravaged by the virus.\\n\\n\"The more we test, the better, but we have to realize that our resources are limited and need to use it strategically,\" tweeted Hassan Zaraket, a virologist and assistant professor at the American University of Beirut. \"If we had been missing many cases we would have explosion at ER & ICU.\"\\n\\nLebanese security forces stop cars at a highway checkpoint north of Beirut on April 6, as authorities implemented further measures restricting the movement of vehicles.\\n\\nWhile it may be too soon to say if the spread of coronavirus will continue to slow, Howland says she has taken comfort in Lebanon\\'s strict measures. \"The government got ahead of the problem and so far (the number of cases) hasn\\'t escalated,\" she says.\\n\\nThe White House\\'s response, she argues, stands in sharp contrast with that of her crisis-ridden adopted country.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump has come under fire for being slow to act in stopping the rapid spread of the disease there. The country now has the highest number of reported cases and deaths from the virus globally, and a prominent model that tracks the coronavirus in the US predicted on Wednesday that more than 60,000 people will die due to Covid-19 by August.\\n\\n\"Watching how Trump has handled this crisis ... it just seems that people are not really aware of what\\'s going on and not taking the proper decisions,\" says Howland.\\n\\nEmployees work while wearing protective face shields and gloves at a store in the northern Lebanese city of Batroun on March 23.\\n\\nFears of long-term pain in Lebanon\\n\\nOthers believe that cash-strapped Lebanon has yet to see the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nWhen Lebanese-American Hana Murr received an email with the US embassy\\'s offer for repatriation last week, she saw it as an opportunity to flee a deepening economic crisis.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve always had a weak state and we\\'re going to get affected greatly by that as a result,\" says Murr. \"The government now has to play catch-up. They\\'re doing a pretty decent job. I am surprised. My expectations were very low, and they\\'ve exceeded them.\"\\n\\nBut she adds: \"The downward spiral of the economy and the dangers that coronavirus pose make me very afraid, and I want to get out before it all comes to a head.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m happy, heartbroken, relieved, depressed and it changes every 10 minutes,\" says Murr, hours before boarding a flight back to her home state of Florida.\\n\\nSpeaking from her Beirut apartment, Montana-native Fuglei says she may have been tempted to return to the US, had she had more faith in its leadership.\\n\\n\"To be honest, if we still had an Obama administration or any kind of confidence then maybe we (Americans in Beirut) would have felt differently,\" she says. \"They probably would have enacted something where I had a clear healthcare plan going back, or where housing was being compensated, or having a clear package of benefits that I could have come back to,\" Fuglei adds.\\n\\n\"I just have zero trust.\"',\n",

However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).\\n\\nIf you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If youâ€™re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill â€“ ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.\\n\\nHowever, masks will probably make little difference if youâ€™re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.\\n\\nClaim: â€˜It is mutating into a more deadly strainâ€™\\n\\nAll viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection â€“ the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most â€œsuccessfulâ€�. This doesnâ€™t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.\\n\\nGenetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.\\n\\nThe team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more â€œaggressiveâ€�, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage â€“ there havenâ€™t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.\\n\\nClaim: â€˜It is no more dangerous than winter fluâ€™\\n\\nMany individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the countryâ€™s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.\\n\\nClaim: â€˜It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relaxâ€™\\n\\nMost people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups â€“ health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.\\n\\nClaim: â€˜You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutesâ€™\\n\\nFor flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.\\n\\nClaim: â€˜A vaccine could be ready within a few monthsâ€™\\n\\nScientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking â€“ and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.â€™',\n",
       " 'â€œThis disease has challenged everything that we believed was right six weeks ago.â€� â€œItâ€™s different than anything weâ€™ve seen before, and maybe the way weâ€™ve taken care of things is not the right way of doing it.â€� â€œThere is a lively and healthy debate, that I think is a good debate, about what the right thing to do here is.â€� â€œIâ€™m concerned that if we continue on the path that weâ€™re on, that hundreds of thousands of lives and lungs may be at risk.â€� â€œItâ€™s actually kind of vital that we not deviate from those treatment protocols because we know that they reduce mortality.â€� â€œLow oxygen levels.â€� â€œThey will tire out within a few hours. So whatâ€™s your next step?â€� â€œBefore Covid-19, I would recommend putting you on a breathing machine.â€� â€œI would have rushed to intubate.â€� â€œBecause that was probably the right thing to do.â€� â€œI know when to put in a breathing tube. Iâ€™ve worked long enough, and Iâ€™ve worked enough places with enough people. But in this disease, it is extremely confusing, you know, it just doesnâ€™t make sense. Listen, I stocked up for the apocalypse, like most people. Now, I just canâ€™t believe that I ever thought that Iâ€™d somehow be home to make all my frozen food. On a normal day in an I.C.U., you have very sick patients. Patients will â€” are dying, but this is just different. Itâ€™s just â€” you have a disease we donâ€™t understand that is very deadly with patients that are scared and staff that are scared, and on top of that, it does not appear that we have a good treatment strategy other than a ventilator. And we donâ€™t â€” weâ€™re not sure when to put a breathing tube in. The crux of it is, we donâ€™t want to put a breathing tube into someone who doesnâ€™t need it knowing that thereâ€™s a 70 percent chance theyâ€™ll die, and then we donâ€™t want to not put it into someone who would need it too late. When you go to the E.R., and thereâ€™s like 40 people that need oxygen, and they all look terrible, but they can all talk to you.â€� â€œAnd no apparent distress whatsoever.â€� â€œAnd then you get them on a monitor, and you look up, and you see this oxygen saturation of 45 percent or 50 percent.â€� â€œAnd telling myself this is impossible. This is not possible. How can this be?â€� â€œItâ€™s just not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation that low.â€� â€œYou know, this is strange. Itâ€™s out of a horror movie.â€� â€œIâ€™ve been unable to sleep because Iâ€™m trying to wrap my head around it. This goes against anything Iâ€™ve ever believed.â€� â€œThe paradigm of ARDS is not matching with the patients that Iâ€™m seeing, so itâ€™s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.â€� â€œThe core of the core of the core â€” it is just, what disease are we treating? And are we treating something that is naturally ARDS, or are we not?â€� â€œWe protect the lung against what we do to the lung. Protect it from what? From what we do in mechanical ventilation.â€� â€œSo what he is saying is that we just have to be gentle. People will need a ventilator, and those that do need as high oxygen as possible, as little pressure as possible, in order to buy time until this demon virus stops.â€� â€œThese patients have ARDS. I think the editorial has both been misinterpreted, and I think people have misunderstood that itâ€™s just that. Itâ€™s an editorial. Itâ€™s not a study and itâ€™s not a trial. I donâ€™t doubt that people have seen some cases with some terrifyingly low oxygen numbers. On average, theyâ€™re as sick as prior cohorts with ARDS.â€� â€œI just think itâ€™s important to say that itâ€™s not a settled question. Every hospital in the world is probably solving its problems slightly differently.â€� â€œWeâ€™re using an early intubation strategy here, and of our first 66 patients, already a third of them have been extubated. Iâ€™m arguing for evidence-based medicine, which is something that we all purported to agree with before this outbreak hit. We have large, randomized, controlled trials. The patients in those trials had met the same diagnostic criteria that our current patients meet. We should apply the results of the trials.â€� â€œToday, we do not rush to intubate. Intubate shouldnâ€™t â€” has become the last resort, and the protocol once theyâ€™re intubated has changed drastically.â€� â€œSo within the last two weeks, I mean, what has been unacceptable has become very acceptable. Some of these patients donâ€™t need to be intubated. You watch them carefully. You make sure their oxygenation is adequate, and they can recover.â€� â€œI am not saying we donâ€™t need ventilators, but perhaps we need to think about how weâ€™re using them. Somebody, and preferably people that are not taking care of patients every day, needs to look at the disease and figure out how we can treat it better.â€� â€œThe truth will come out eventually. In the meantime, the question is: What do we do until that happens? And yes, Iâ€™m nervous. Iâ€™m scared everyday when I go into work, but Iâ€™m just trying to do the best I can.â€�',\n",

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as theyâ€™re published.\\n\\nOlga Matievskaya and her fellow intensive care nurses at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey were so desperate for gowns and masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus that they turned to the online fundraising site GoFundMe to raise money.\\n\\nThe donations flowed in â€” more than $12,000 â€” and Matievskaya used some of them to buy about 500 masks, 4,000 shoe covers and 150 jumpsuits. She and her colleagues at the hospital celebrated protecting themselves and their patients from the spread of the virus.\\n\\nBut rather than thanking the staff, hospital administrators on Saturday suspended Matievskaya for distributing â€œunauthorizedâ€� protective gear.\\n\\nAcross the country, front-line medical providers and hospital administrators are butting heads about precautions against the coronavirus pandemic. Clinicians are being told to reuse or go without necessary supplies even when treating patients infected with COVID-19. That goes against the way theyâ€™ve been trained. Some doctors and nurses now say they are being instructed not to speak to journalists and disciplined for doing so or taking action to protect themselves.\\n\\nHelp Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\\n\\nMatievskaya spoke to ProPublica last week about the fundraising campaign. She said she had been able to purchase most of what the nurses needed on eBay. She did not criticize her administrators, and after her suspension she declined to comment. But four other Newark Beth Israel nurses spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity about the dire shortage of gear.\\n\\nAll four said their administration has failed to provide the supplies they need to protect themselves and patients. Two of them work in the intensive care unit, which houses the sickest patients. The other two work in other areas of the hospital. They said Matievskaya showed leadership to keep people safe where their hospital administration has not. â€œThere was no information distributedâ€� about not being allowed to purchase supplies for others on staff, one of the nurses told ProPublica.\\n\\nThe hospital told ProPublica in a statement that Matievskayaâ€™s suspension ended Monday. â€œNo employee is allowed to distribute unauthorized medical supplies within the hospital,â€� the statement said. â€œThe nurse in question was temporarily suspended for inappropriately distributing unauthorized medical supplies, against this policy.â€�\\n\\nThe hospital said it ensures clinicians have the supplies they need by following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for reusing gear. â€œWe are working 24-hours a day, 7-days a week to ensure that the appropriate PPE gets to the right staff, at the right time,â€� the hospital said in its statement.\\n\\nIt did not answer questions about what would become of the supplies purchased through the campaign or whether other nurses who participated in the fundraising might be subject to discipline.\\n\\nA screenshot of a GoFundMe post by nurse Olga Matievskaya, who was suspended by Newark Beth Israel for distributing â€œunauthorized medical supplies.â€� (Obtained by ProPublica)\\n\\nThe confrontation at Newark Beth Israel may foretell whatâ€™s coming in other cities. Northern New Jersey, just outside New York City, is one of the nationâ€™s hotspots, with more than 41,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Monday. As of Thursday, the 665-bed hospital had housed 196 COVID-19 patients, according to an internal communication to hospital staff. Hospitals across the country have shortages of protective equipment, according to a report published Monday by the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nAline Holmes, a clinical associate professor at the Rutgers School of Nursing, said she didnâ€™t know the details of the case but was â€œvery surprisedâ€� to hear of Matievskayaâ€™s suspension. Hospital administrators are telling clinicians to reuse supplies, she said, which violates typical infection control standards. Suspending a nurse for obtaining protective equipment â€œdoesnâ€™t make any sense,â€� Holmes said.\\n\\nâ€œThat just seems counterintuitive and really not a good message to send to your staff,â€� Holmes said. â€œThe staff have a right to protect themselves. If the hospital canâ€™t provide the necessary supplies, they have a right to do what they need to do. Theyâ€™re caring for the sickest patients in the hospital right now.â€�\\n\\nThe situation is changing by the day as Newark Beth Israel acquires and runs through its supplies. But the four nurses told ProPublica that they have often not been given the N95 respirator masks the CDC has recommended to protect themselves from the virus. One of the ICU nurses said for at least one shift she received a regular surgical mask, which in her opinion is â€œlike putting a paper towel over your face.â€�\\n\\nSome nurses outside the intensive care unit have been given a single surgical mask in a brown paper bag that theyâ€™re expected to use for an entire week, one nurse said. Nurses at other hospitals around the country have made similar statements.\\n\\nThe shortage of gowns has also been a big problem, the nurses said. There should be enough to discard a gown after each interaction with an infected patient. But the shortage of gowns has required staff to leave the same gown hanging by the door of an infected patientâ€™s room and reuse it throughout a shift. In at least one case no gowns were available, one nurse said, so the staffer had to use a combination of a patient gown and bedsheet to treat an infected patient.\\n\\nSome nurses in the intensive care unit have been caring for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients on the same shift, the nurses said. So if theyâ€™re not properly protected, the nurses said, they could pick the infection up on their masks or clothing in one room and carry it to the other. The nurses said they have heard of hospital staff testing positive for COVID-19, but they donâ€™t know where they picked it up and the facilityâ€™s administration doesnâ€™t make any total numbers known. â€œWe are spreading it, and we are getting it,â€� one of the nurses said of the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe nurses said the situation is especially desperate because the hospital performs organ transplant operations, and those patients have compromised immune systems. A ProPublica report about the quality problems in the heart transplant program last year led to action by regulators. The hospital made the corrections required by the federal and state regulators, it said in a statement. The FBI also investigated the hospital as a result of the story, but the agency declined to comment Monday.\\n\\nThe nurses said some of the non-COVID-19 patients are heart and lung transplant recipients.\\n\\nâ€œWe understand this is what we signed up for,â€� one ICU nurse told ProPublica. â€œJust provide us with sufficient (protective equipment) so we can give these patients the optimal care that they need, and so we arenâ€™t contaminating others or ourselves.â€�\\n\\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\\n\\nIn some cases, nurses and administrators have disagreed about what is needed to keep them safe. The intensive care nurses said they have asked for jumpsuits, the overalls that cover their entire outfit. But administrators have told them such equipment isnâ€™t required, they said.\\n\\nThe intensive care nurses said they are directed to call a â€œcommand centerâ€� when they need more supplies. But when they reach out, â€œYou get yelled at sometimes,â€� one of the nurses said.\\n\\nThe hospital did not respond when ProPublica asked for an explanation of the various conditions described by the nurses.\\n\\nBut Dr. Matthew Schreiber, the hospitalâ€™s chief operating officer, said in a brief phone conversation that the hospital has the personal protective equipment â€œthat the staff require, which is at times not the same as the (protective equipment) that people want to have. Thereâ€™s lots of items people may bring from somewhere else.â€�\\n\\nFrancis Giantomasi, an attorney who serves as the chairman of the hospitalâ€™s board of trustees, said the problem isnâ€™t a lack of money. Newark Beth Israel had $186 million in net assets, according to its 2017 tax forms. It paid its chief executive officer Darrell Terry more than $1.4 million in salary and compensation, the documents show.\\n\\nGowns and masks and other critical gear â€œare in short supply everywhere and needed by everyone,â€� Giantomasi said. â€œThatâ€™s a serious, troubling, undeniable reality.â€�\\n\\nRead More â€œItâ€™s Very Unethicalâ€�: Audio Shows Hospital Kept Vegetative Patient on Life Support to Boost Survival Rates Darryl Young suffered brain damage during a heart transplant at Newark Beth Israel and never woke up. But, hardly consulting his family, doctors kept him alive for a year to avoid federal scrutiny.\\n\\nOne of the nurses said that if the hospital can afford to pay its CEO so well, then it should be able to go on eBay itself and purchase supplies for the staff.\\n\\nIn its statement the hospital blamed the problem on the way supplies are distributed. â€œNo one person, institution, or hospital can independently correct this global supply shortage,â€� it said.\\n\\nChris Neuwirth, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, said he feels that New Jersey is as prepared as it could have been. The 9/11 terrorist attacks, Superstorm Sandy and other events gave the emergency infrastructure a head start, he said. Meetings with hospital leaders began in early February. But the scope and magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic is beyond what emergency managers and public health officials could have anticipated, he said. When the crisis subsides, he predicted, there will be a reassessment of the stockpiles and what hospitals and health departments need to do in order to be prepared.\\n\\nHolmes, the Rutgers professor, said hospital administrators need to step up and lead the providers on the front lines by communicating and building trust. If the staff members donâ€™t trust the administration, they might refuse to risk their lives and the health of their families, she said. They might stay home, she said.\\n\\nMedical providers will not forget how administrators treated them when the COVID-19 pandemic is over, said Dr. Zubin Damania, a Stanford-trained physician who is now a popular social media personality known as ZDoggMD. Damania has more than 1.6 million Facebook followers and is pushing for clinicians to reform American health care. He said he is getting more than 250 private messages a week from doctors, nurses and other health care providers, lamenting the lack of protective equipment and unclear communication and intimidation theyâ€™re getting from their administrators. In Mississippi, two doctors were reportedly fired for speaking out about coronavirus safety. A similar case was reported in Washington state.\\n\\nâ€œThereâ€™s so much distrust, and itâ€™s all borne out of poor coordination of leadership that should know better,â€� Damania said.\\n\\nCaroline Chen contributed reporting.',\n",

We have many positions that are unstaffed because we canâ€™t get approval.â€�\\n\\nTrump said there were 129 nominees â€œstuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.â€�\\n\\nTrumpâ€™s argument seemed to be that many of these vacancies needed to be filled to assist with the coronavirus response, including the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department and an Undersecretary of Agriculture.\\n\\nThe President argued that since the Senate has left until May 4, â€œthe Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances. The recess appointment, itâ€™s called. The Senateâ€™s practice of gaveling into so-called pro-forma sessions where no one is even there has prevented me from using the Constitutional authority weâ€™re given,â€� Trump said, calling on the Senate to formally adjourn.\\n\\nThe decision to stay away from Washington until May 4 was made, and announced, by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and close Trump ally.\\n\\nA McConnell spokesman said Trump and McConnell spoke about the issue today. â€œThe Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the Covid-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from Leader Schumer.\"\\n\\nThat last point is an important one. McConnell, who is careful with his words, appears to be saying any solution to the confirmation issue will require Democratic consent.\\n\\nThe Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval. But lawmakers in both parties have sought to thwart certain appointments over the last decade by never technically shutting down the Senate.\\n\\nWhen then-President Barack Obama attempted to make recess appointments during pro-forma sessions in 2014, the US Supreme Court ruled \"that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue.\" Justice Stephen Breyer said, \"We hold that the Senate is in session, and not in recess, when the Senate says that it is in session.\\n\\nHowever, tonight Trump said he may use powers granted to the executive branch in order to get Congress to return to Washington to fill vacancies and vote on relief aid.\\n\\nâ€œI have a very strong power. Iâ€™d rather not use that power but we have way over a 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Constitution says the President \"may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.\" The Court did not rule on that clause, as it was never invoked by the Obama administration or any prior administration.\\n\\nGiven the authority has never been invoked before, itâ€™s murky as to what would define â€œdisagreementâ€� in this case. Both chambers would technically need to adjourn to clear the way for recess appointments, and the Democratic-led House is exceedingly unlikely to hold a vote to adjourn.\\n\\nThat means McConnell would likely have to bring senators back to Washington to vote to adjourn in order to create the â€œdisagreementâ€� cited in the Constitution that would provide the grounds for Trump to act. The Senate has been out of Washington out of concern over the safety of senators due to the pandemic.\\n\\nTrump, as he sought to explain his consideration of the action, took special note of Michael Pack, the Presidentâ€™s choice to lead the Broadcasting Board of Governors, whose organization doesnâ€™t hold a clear role in the federal governmentâ€™s coronavirus health or economic response.\\n\\nTrump specifically cited his nomination to head the board of Voice of America as a particular grievance in not getting appointed, and continued to attack the news organization.\\n\\nâ€œHeâ€™s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America, very important. And if youâ€™ve heard whatâ€™s coming out of the Voice of America, itâ€™s disgusting. The things they say are disgusting toward our country,â€� Trump said of Pack.\\n\\nTrump did not explain how the nominee to be CEO of the US Agency for Global Media would enhance federal efforts to counter the pandemic.\\n\\nBut he reiterated his threat to adjourn both chambers of Congress several times.\\n\\nâ€œIf they donâ€™t approve it, weâ€™re gonna go this route,â€� Trump said. â€œWe are going to do something that will be something I prefer not doing.â€�',\n",
