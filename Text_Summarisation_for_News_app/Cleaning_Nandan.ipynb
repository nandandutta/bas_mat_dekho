       "'The erstwhile Bill was first introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016.\\n\\nIt aims to make illegal migrants â€“ who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan â€“ eligible for citizenship, on the basis of religion. It offer citizenship to these six identified non-Muslim minorities who reportedly fled from Indiaâ€™s neighbouring countries due to â€˜religious persecutionâ€™.\\n\\nThis aims to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, which did not allow citizenship to any kind of illegal migrants. The Act seems to be a follow up of the promise made by the BJP in 2014, to grant citizenship to Hindus persecuted in the neighbouring countries. In the BJP manifesto for the 2014 elections, the party had promised to welcome Hindu refugees and provide shelter to them.\\n\\nIt also relaxes the Actâ€™s requirement of an applicant securing citizenship by naturalisation, where for people belonging to the same six religions and three countries, it relaxes the 11-year requirement for the applicant to reside in India to six years.\\n\\nIt also states that the registration of the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card-holders can be cancelled if they â€œviolate any lawâ€�. The OCI is an immigration status which allows a foreign citizen of Indian origin to live and work in India, indefinitely. The Act, however, will only take into account the grant of citizenship to those who migrated to India before 31 December, 2014.\\n\\nIn many ways, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 aims to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, which has specific provisions listing out who can be considered eligible for citizenship.'"

We are marshaling the full power of American nation economic, scientific, medical and military to vanquish the virus,\" Trump said at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. \"And we will do that.\"\\n\\n\"This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York,\" he added.\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in front of the USNS Comfort at Naval Station Norfolk, in Norfolk, Va., March 28, 2020. The ship is departing for New York to assist hospitals responding to the coronavirus outbreak. Defense Secretary Mark Esper is at right. Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\nNew York is the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. The ship is expected to arrive Monday.\\n\\n\"After being rushed out of maintenance, with historic speed, it was supposed to be here for four weeks, and they did it and four days,\" Trump said. \"The Comfort will arrive at Pier 90 in Manhattan on Monday, three weeks ahead of schedule. Its crew will begin treating patients on Tuesday.\"\\n\\nIt will be met on the pier by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Trump added, saying Cuomo\\'s \"very excited\" for the help.\\n\\nThe president was introduced by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who said the sailors and medical professionals were \"eager to get underway and start their very important mission\" to aggressively respond to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump waves as the USNS Comfort pulls away from the pier at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Va., March 28, 2020. The ship is headed to New York to assist hospitals responding to the coronavirus outbreak. Defense Secretary Mark Esper is at right. Patrick Semansky/AP\\n\\n\"The skilled medical professionals who will set sail on the Comfort will play a critical role in freeing up capacity in hospital beds in the New York area,\" Esper added.\\n\\nComfort\\'s main mission, Trump said, will be to take care of the New Yorkers who aren\\'t infected with COVID-19 but still require urgent care.\\n\\n\"So the people with the virus will not be on ship,\" he reassured. \"The ship will be used for people having operations and other things.\"\\n\\nThe ship is equipped with 1,000 patient beds, 12 fully equipped operating rooms, eight intensive care unit beds, four radiology suites, up to 1,200 Navy medical and communications personnel and more than 70 civil service mariners.\\n\\nComfort, like its counterpart the USNS Mercy, which arrived in Los Angeles on Friday, also will have up to 5,000 units of blood, two oxygen-producing plants and an isolation ward.\\n\\n\"It is stocked. It\\'s stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of,\" Trump said. \"Importantly, by treating non-infected patients remotely on the ship, it will help to halt very strongly the transmission of the virus.\"\\n\\nBoth of the \"floating hospitals\" also contain a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab and a CAT scan. They also have a helicopter deck capable of landing large helicopters and side ports to take on patients at sea.\\n\\n\"These are true professionals, and no one performs better under pressure when lives are on the line. These are incredible people,\" the president said. \"We will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers and the health of the people of our country in their hour of need.\"\\n\\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: coronavirus map\\n\\nABC News\\' Elizabeth McLaughlin and Christina Carrega contributed to this report.'"
