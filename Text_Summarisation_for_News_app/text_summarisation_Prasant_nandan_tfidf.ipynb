Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\\n\\nOlga Matievskaya and her fellow intensive care nurses at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey were so desperate for gowns and masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus that they turned to the online fundraising site GoFundMe to raise money.\\n\\nThe donations flowed in — more than $12,000 — and Matievskaya used some of them to buy about 500 masks, 4,000 shoe covers and 150 jumpsuits. She and her colleagues at the hospital celebrated protecting themselves and their patients from the spread of the virus.\\n\\nBut rather than thanking the staff, hospital administrators on Saturday suspended Matievskaya for distributing “unauthorized” protective gear.\\n\\nAcross the country, front-line medical providers and hospital administrators are butting heads about precautions against the coronavirus pandemic. Clinicians are being told to reuse or go without necessary supplies even when treating patients infected with COVID-19. That goes against the way they’ve been trained. Some doctors and nurses now say they are being instructed not to speak to journalists and disciplined for doing so or taking action to protect themselves.\\n\\nHelp Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\\n\\nMatievskaya spoke to ProPublica last week about the fundraising campaign. She said she had been able to purchase most of what the nurses needed on eBay. She did not criticize her administrators, and after her suspension she declined to comment. But four other Newark Beth Israel nurses spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity about the dire shortage of gear.\\n\\nAll four said their administration has failed to provide the supplies they need to protect themselves and patients. Two of them work in the intensive care unit, which houses the sickest patients. The other two work in other areas of the hospital. They said Matievskaya showed leadership to keep people safe where their hospital administration has not. “There was no information distributed” about not being allowed to purchase supplies for others on staff, one of the nurses told ProPublica.\\n\\nThe hospital told ProPublica in a statement that Matievskaya’s suspension ended Monday. “No employee is allowed to distribute unauthorized medical supplies within the hospital,” the statement said. “The nurse in question was temporarily suspended for inappropriately distributing unauthorized medical supplies, against this policy.”\\n\\nThe hospital said it ensures clinicians have the supplies they need by following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for reusing gear. “We are working 24-hours a day, 7-days a week to ensure that the appropriate PPE gets to the right staff, at the right time,” the hospital said in its statement.\\n\\nIt did not answer questions about what would become of the supplies purchased through the campaign or whether other nurses who participated in the fundraising might be subject to discipline.\\n\\nA screenshot of a GoFundMe post by nurse Olga Matievskaya, who was suspended by Newark Beth Israel for distributing “unauthorized medical supplies.” (Obtained by ProPublica)\\n\\nThe confrontation at Newark Beth Israel may foretell what’s coming in other cities. Northern New Jersey, just outside New York City, is one of the nation’s hotspots, with more than 41,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Monday. As of Thursday, the 665-bed hospital had housed 196 COVID-19 patients, according to an internal communication to hospital staff. Hospitals across the country have shortages of protective equipment, according to a report published Monday by the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nAline Holmes, a clinical associate professor at the Rutgers School of Nursing, said she didn’t know the details of the case but was “very surprised” to hear of Matievskaya’s suspension. Hospital administrators are telling clinicians to reuse supplies, she said, which violates typical infection control standards. Suspending a nurse for obtaining protective equipment “doesn’t make any sense,” Holmes said.\\n\\n“That just seems counterintuitive and really not a good message to send to your staff,” Holmes said. “The staff have a right to protect themselves. If the hospital can’t provide the necessary supplies, they have a right to do what they need to do. They’re caring for the sickest patients in the hospital right now.”\\n\\nThe situation is changing by the day as Newark Beth Israel acquires and runs through its supplies. But the four nurses told ProPublica that they have often not been given the N95 respirator masks the CDC has recommended to protect themselves from the virus. One of the ICU nurses said for at least one shift she received a regular surgical mask, which in her opinion is “like putting a paper towel over your face.”\\n\\nSome nurses outside the intensive care unit have been given a single surgical mask in a brown paper bag that they’re expected to use for an entire week, one nurse said. Nurses at other hospitals around the country have made similar statements.\\n\\nThe shortage of gowns has also been a big problem, the nurses said. There should be enough to discard a gown after each interaction with an infected patient. But the shortage of gowns has required staff to leave the same gown hanging by the door of an infected patient’s room and reuse it throughout a shift. In at least one case no gowns were available, one nurse said, so the staffer had to use a combination of a patient gown and bedsheet to treat an infected patient.\\n\\nSome nurses in the intensive care unit have been caring for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients on the same shift, the nurses said. So if they’re not properly protected, the nurses said, they could pick the infection up on their masks or clothing in one room and carry it to the other. The nurses said they have heard of hospital staff testing positive for COVID-19, but they don’t know where they picked it up and the facility’s administration doesn’t make any total numbers known. “We are spreading it, and we are getting it,” one of the nurses said of the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe nurses said the situation is especially desperate because the hospital performs organ transplant operations, and those patients have compromised immune systems. A ProPublica report about the quality problems in the heart transplant program last year led to action by regulators. The hospital made the corrections required by the federal and state regulators, it said in a statement. The FBI also investigated the hospital as a result of the story, but the agency declined to comment Monday.\\n\\nThe nurses said some of the non-COVID-19 patients are heart and lung transplant recipients.\\n\\n“We understand this is what we signed up for,” one ICU nurse told ProPublica. “Just provide us with sufficient (protective equipment) so we can give these patients the optimal care that they need, and so we aren’t contaminating others or ourselves.”\\n\\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\\n\\nIn some cases, nurses and administrators have disagreed about what is needed to keep them safe. The intensive care nurses said they have asked for jumpsuits, the overalls that cover their entire outfit. But administrators have told them such equipment isn’t required, they said.\\n\\nThe intensive care nurses said they are directed to call a “command center” when they need more supplies. But when they reach out, “You get yelled at sometimes,” one of the nurses said.\\n\\nThe hospital did not respond when ProPublica asked for an explanation of the various conditions described by the nurses.\\n\\nBut Dr. Matthew Schreiber, the hospital’s chief operating officer, said in a brief phone conversation that the hospital has the personal protective equipment “that the staff require, which is at times not the same as the (protective equipment) that people want to have. There’s lots of items people may bring from somewhere else.”\\n\\nFrancis Giantomasi, an attorney who serves as the chairman of the hospital’s board of trustees, said the problem isn’t a lack of money. Newark Beth Israel had $186 million in net assets, according to its 2017 tax forms. It paid its chief executive officer Darrell Terry more than $1.4 million in salary and compensation, the documents show.\\n\\nGowns and masks and other critical gear “are in short supply everywhere and needed by everyone,” Giantomasi said. “That’s a serious, troubling, undeniable reality.”\\n\\nRead More “It’s Very Unethical”: Audio Shows Hospital Kept Vegetative Patient on Life Support to Boost Survival Rates Darryl Young suffered brain damage during a heart transplant at Newark Beth Israel and never woke up. But, hardly consulting his family, doctors kept him alive for a year to avoid federal scrutiny.\\n\\nOne of the nurses said that if the hospital can afford to pay its CEO so well, then it should be able to go on eBay itself and purchase supplies for the staff.\\n\\nIn its statement the hospital blamed the problem on the way supplies are distributed. “No one person, institution, or hospital can independently correct this global supply shortage,” it said.\\n\\nChris Neuwirth, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, said he feels that New Jersey is as prepared as it could have been. The 9/11 terrorist attacks, Superstorm Sandy and other events gave the emergency infrastructure a head start, he said. Meetings with hospital leaders began in early February. But the scope and magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic is beyond what emergency managers and public health officials could have anticipated, he said. When the crisis subsides, he predicted, there will be a reassessment of the stockpiles and what hospitals and health departments need to do in order to be prepared.\\n\\nHolmes, the Rutgers professor, said hospital administrators need to step up and lead the providers on the front lines by communicating and building trust. If the staff members don’t trust the administration, they might refuse to risk their lives and the health of their families, she said. They might stay home, she said.\\n\\nMedical providers will not forget how administrators treated them when the COVID-19 pandemic is over, said Dr. Zubin Damania, a Stanford-trained physician who is now a popular social media personality known as ZDoggMD. Damania has more than 1.6 million Facebook followers and is pushing for clinicians to reform American health care. He said he is getting more than 250 private messages a week from doctors, nurses and other health care providers, lamenting the lack of protective equipment and unclear communication and intimidation they’re getting from their administrators. In Mississippi, two doctors were reportedly fired for speaking out about coronavirus safety. A similar case was reported in Washington state.\\n\\n“There’s so much distrust, and it’s all borne out of poor coordination of leadership that should know better,” Damania said.\\n\\nCaroline Chen

       "The truth about how you can catch coronavirus, who is most vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infection\\n\\nClaim: ‘Face masks don’t work’\\n\\nWearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).\\n\\nIf you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.\\n\\nHowever, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.\\n\\nClaim: ‘It is mutating into a more deadly strain’\\n\\nAll viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.\\n\\nGenetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.\\n\\nThe team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.\\n\\nClaim: ‘It is no more dangerous than winter flu’\\n\\nMany individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.\\n\\nClaim: ‘It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax’\\n\\nMost people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.\\n\\nClaim: ‘You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes’\\n\\nFor flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.\\n\\nClaim: ‘A vaccine could be ready within a few months’\\n\\nScientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’

       "Human trials will begin imminently – but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible\\n\\nEven at their most effective – and draconian – containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.\\n\\nAbout 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials imminently.\\n\\nThis unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.\\n\\nBut there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.\\n\\nCoronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.\\n\\nSars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.\\n\\nAll vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.\\n\\nTraditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is using, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another company which has a presence in Boston, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.\\n\\nCepi’s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.\\n\\nClinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there’s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.\\n\\nThere are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it’s really important not to take shortcuts.”\\n\\nAn illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.\\n\\nIt’s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That’s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.\\n\\nIn the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it’s going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.\\n\\nOnce a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”\\n\\nThe problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.\\n\\nBecause pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.\\n\\nOutside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?”\\n\\nThis is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, “will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available”. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 19 March 2020.

       "A prestigious scientific panel told the White House last night that research shows coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes or coughs, but also just by talking, or possibly even just breathing.\\n\\n\"While the current [coronavirus] specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing,\" according to the letter, written by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats.\\n\\nHe said his letter was sent in response to a query from Kelvin Droegemeier with the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House.\\n\\n\"This letter responds to your question concerning the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread by conversation, in addition to sneeze/cough-induced droplets,\" the letter states. \"Currently available research supports the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation,\" it continues.\\n\\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus spreads from person to person when people are within about six feet of each other. It spreads \"through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\"\\n\\nFineberg told CNN this is true — but that research shows that aerosolized droplets produced by talking or possibly even by just breathing can also spread the virus.\\n\\nFineberg said it's possible that aerosolized coronavirus droplets can hang in the air and potentially infect someone who walks by later. How long coronavirus lingers in the air depends on several factors, including how much virus an infected individual puts out when breathing or talking, and also on the amount of circulation in the air, he said.\\n\\nHe added, however, that coronavirus is not as infectious as measles or tuberculosis.

       "January Timeline:\\n\\nHow dangerous is the virus?\\n\\nThere are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus:\\n\\nTransmission Rate ( Ro ) - number of newly infected people from a single case\\n\\n) - number of newly infected people from a single case Case Fatality Rate (CFR) - percent of cases that result in death\\n\\nDetermine whether asymptomatic transmission is possible\\n\\nHow contagious is the Wuhan Coronavirus? (Ro)\\n\\nThe attack rate or transmissibility (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced R-nought or r-zero), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus.\\n\\nWHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5. [13]\\n\\nOther studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58. [23].\\n\\nPreliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between 1.5 and 3.5. [5][6][7]\\n\\nAn outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear.\\n\\nFor comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0.\\n\\nFatality Rate (case fatality ratio or CFR) of the Wuhan Coronavirus\\n\\nSee full details: Coronavirus Fatality Rate\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus' case fatality rate has been estimated at around 2%, in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020 [16] . However, it noted that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality rate figure.\\n\\nA prior estimate [9] had put that number at 3%.\\n\\nFatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists.\\n\\nFor comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%.\\n\\nIncubation Period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear)\\n\\nSee full details: COVID-19 Coronavirus Incubation Period\\n\\nSymptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 (estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14 days, and 10-14 days, see details), during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom (asymptomatic transmission).\\n\\nAge and conditions of Coronavirus cases\\n\\nSee latest findings: Age, Sex, Demographics of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths\\n\\nAccording to early estimates by China's National Health Commission (NHC), about 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 and 75% of them had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[24]\\n\\nAccording to the WHO Situation Report no. 7 issued on Jan. 27:\\n\\nThe median age of cases detected outside of China is 45 years, ranging from 2 to 74 years.\\n\\ndetected of China is 45 years, ranging from 2 to 74 years. 71% of cases were male.\\n\\nA study of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP found that the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.[25]\\n\\nThe WHO, in its Myth busters FAQs, addresses the question: \"Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?\" by answering that:\\n\\nPeople of all ages can be infected by the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\\n\\nby the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.\\n\\nPatient who died in the Philippines was a 44-year old male\\n\\nSerious Cases of 30 year old patients in France\\n\\nThe patient who died in the Philippines on February 2, in what was the first death occurring outside of China, was a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who was admitted on Jan. 25 after experiencing fever, cough, and sore throat, before developing severe pneumonia. In the last few days, “the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement, however, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours resulting in his demise.\" according to the Philippine Department of Health.\\n\\nAs of Jan. 29, according to French authorities, the conditions of the two earliest Paris cases had worsened and the patients were being treated in intensive care, according to French authorities. The patients have been described as a young couple aged 30 and 31 years old, both Chinese citizens from Wuhan who were asymptomatic when they arrived in Paris on January 18 [19].\\n\\nAge and Sex of the first deaths as reported by the China National Health Commission (NHC)\\n\\nThe NHC reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm on January 22, 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the deaths was 75 (range 48-89) years.[21]\\n\\nWHO Risk Assessment: Global Emergency\\n\\nSee full details: WHO coronavirus updates\\n\\nOn January 30, the World Health Organization

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\\n\\nThe Dutch company that received millions of taxpayer dollars to develop an affordable ventilator for pandemics, but never delivered them, has struck a much more lucrative deal with the federal government to make 43,000 ventilators at four times the price.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday that it plans to pay Royal Philips N.V. $646.7 million for the new ventilators — paying more than $15,000 each. The first 2,500 units are to arrive before the end of May, HHS said, and the rest by the end of December.\\n\\nPhilips refused to say which model of ventilator the government was buying. But in response to questions from ProPublica, HHS officials said the government is purchasing the Trilogy EV300, the more expensive version of the ventilator that was developed with federal funds.\\n\\nHelp Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\\n\\nThe deal is a striking departure from the federal contract Philips’ Respironics division signed in September to produce 10,000 ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile at a cost of $3,280 each.\\n\\n“This kind of profiteering — paying four times the negotiated price — is not only irresponsible to taxpayers but is particularly offensive when so many people are out of work,” said Dr. Nicole Lurie, who served as the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the Obama administration. “And besides, most of these ventilators will come too late to make a difference in this pandemic. We’ll then ’replenish’ the stockpile at a ridiculously high price.”\\n\\n“What else,” she asked, “won’t we be able to buy as a result?”\\n\\nIn an article March 30, ProPublica detailed how the agency’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, had anticipated a decade ago that hospitals would run short of life-saving ventilators in the event of a pandemic. BARDA tried to find a company that could produce an inexpensive, durable ventilator that could be operated by people with minimal training during a crisis. After a deal with one company fell apart, HHS in 2014 agreed to pay Philips $13.8 million to design the stockpile ventilator with an option to purchase 10,000 for $3,280 each. The company won Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator in July, and in September HHS put in its order.\\n\\nRead More Taxpayers Paid Millions to Design a Low-Cost Ventilator for a Pandemic. Instead, the Company Is Selling Versions of It Overseas. As coronavirus sweeps the globe, there is not a single Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator — developed with government funds — in the U.S. stockpile. Meanwhile, Royal Philips N.V. has sold higher-priced versions to clients around the world.\\n\\nBut Philips didn’t deliver any ventilators to the stockpile even as the coronavirus spread across the globe and hospitals scrambled for ventilators to keep their patients alive. Rather than making the government-funded design, Philips has been manufacturing more expensive commercial versions of the Trilogy Evo at its Pennsylvania plant and selling them overseas and in the United States.\\n\\nPhilips said it was within its rights to sell the commercial versions first because its contract with HHS gave the company until 2022 to produce the cheaper stockpile version. Philips had only made the stockpile version in small batches and didn’t want to ramp up production on a ventilator that it hadn’t mass produced, a slower process than increasing production of other models, company spokesman Steve Klink explained last month. He also said the government contract did not cover all of the costs for the ventilators’ development.\\n\\nNow the company won’t have to try. The Philips contract announced Wednesday is for the commercial version, the Trilogy EV300, with the government paying $15,039 each.\\n\\nThe HHS statement said the agency purchased “what was immediately available” under “negotiated pricing” with Philips. President Donald Trump directed HHS Secretary Alex Azar to invoke the Defense Production Act in brokering the deal, the statement said.\\n\\nThe government still expects Philips to produce the 10,000 stockpile versions of the ventilator, but no completion date was given in the statement.\\n\\nLurie was in charge of the HHS office that struck the 2014 deal with Philips. During her time, congressional Republicans elected on a Tea Party wave forced cuts in federal spending that hampered efforts to bulk up the stockpile. The goal of the Philips deal, Lurie said, was to produce a low-cost, easy-to-use ventilator and use the stockpile’s budget responsibly. But it was also an effort to show the industry that low-cost ventilators were feasible.\\n\\n“This was a strategy to reduce health care costs,” Lurie said. “This feels like a conspiracy to keep them high.”\\n\\nIn a news release touting the deal on Wednesday, Philips said that it has been ramping up production and this year has delivered several thousand ventilators to U.S. hospitals — including one in hard-hit New York City. The company, which only makes ventilators in the U.S., said it wanted to continue selling ventilators to other countries in need. Klink declined to comment further.\\n\\nJohn Hick, an emergency medicine specialist in Minneapolis who has advised HHS on pandemic response, said it would have been better to have a simpler and cheaper ventilator on hand.\\n\\n“Don’t get me wrong, I am happy they are getting ventilators,” he said. “If you could buy four times as many for the price, why wouldn’t you do that?”\\n\\nHick hopes that federal officials will learn a lesson from the Philips deal.\\n\\n“We have lost a lot of time,” he said. “It’s kind of like telling someone we are going to hurricane-proof your house after the hurricane has hit.”\\n\\nTell Us More About Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

       "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Carly Fuglei was with a group of Danish friends in Beirut last month when she first considered moving back to the United States. They were preparing to leave Lebanon amid fears of a major coronavirus outbreak there, and tried to convince her to do the same.\\n\\nBut the 28-year-old humanitarian consultant from Montana decided to stay. After Lebanon closed its borders on March 19 to stem the spread of the global pandemic, she began furnishing her rooftop terrace. Her time in Beirut, she realized, would be indefinite.\\n\\n\"I made that decision for a combination of personal reasons and calculations about the virus that we're all making,\" says Fuglei. \"I think that I am probably safer here.\"\\n\\nIt's a decision that several US citizens in Beirut who CNN spoke to have echoed, citing skyrocketing cases in the US . When the US government last week said it would fly its citizens and permanent residents to the US on a chartered flight for $2,500 per person, some Americans took to Twitter to publicly decline the offer.\\n\\n\"And no, Mom, I'm not going,\" Beirut-based freelance journalist Abby Sewell wrote in a tweet about the US embassy announcement.\\n\\nResponding to her tweet, a Lebanese journalist said: \"For once I'm like no America is not safer than here.\" Sewell's mother, Meg Sewell, replied: \"Actually, for the moment I might have to agree.\"\\n\\nSewell tells CNN she never considered taking the US embassy's offer.\\n\\n\"From everything I'm reading, the situation is worse in the US, in terms of the number of cases, prevention measures or lack thereof, and how overburdened the health system is,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Also, since I've been living overseas for years, I don't have health insurance in the US now, so if I did go back and then got sick, I would be looking at paying thousands of dollars out of pocket.\"\\n\\nLebanese soldiers, wearing protective equipment, stand guard at Beirut international airport on April 5, ahead of the arrival of returning nationals.\\n\\nOn the morning of April 5, the US embassy flew 95 US citizens out of Lebanon, according to a US State Department official. It is estimated that thousands of Americans live in Lebanon -- many of whom also hold Lebanese citizenship.\\n\\n\"The Department of State has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,\" the official told CNN. \"We are rising to meet the historic challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, every day, all over the world.\"\\n\\nWhen asked about Americans suggesting that Beirut is, for once, safer than the US, the official declined to comment.\\n\\nA rapid outbreak back home\\n\\nDaryn Howland, 27, is hunkered down in her Beirut apartment, diving into her work as a consultant. \"My plan is to stay here for the indefinite future,\" says the Boston native.\\n\\n\"The fact that things are so bad in the US means it's one of the first times where it's safer to be in Lebanon than in the US,\" Howland also echoes. \"Despite the (Lebanese political and economic) situation ... I think my odds are better here.\"\\n\\n\"All of my American friends here have decided to stay,\" she adds.\\n\\nWhen the first novel coronavirus case was reported in Lebanon on February 21, the country was already awash with crises.\\n\\nNationwide protests erupted against the country's political elite last October, toppling the government of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and deepening a political crisis. Already under increasing pressure, the country's currency tanked. Last month, Beirut announced its first ever debt default.\\n\\nUnder widespread pressure from activists and media, the freshly-minted government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed not to take any chances with the virus, despite the toll any measures might take on the already troubled economy.\\n\\nSanitary workers disinfect the desks and chairs of the Lebanese Parliament on March 10.\\n\\nEight days after that first case, on February 29, the country closed its schools and universities. On March 6, it shuttered restaurants and cafes, ahead of several western European countries, such as Italy, in enforcing such a measure. The government then announced a lockdown on March 15.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the spread of the coronavirus in Lebanon has slowed, according to the World Health Organization's Lebanon office. Medical professionals have offered cautious praise for the country's relatively early steps to enforce the lockdown.\\n\\n\"We're not at a stage where we have to decide who gets a ventilator and who doesn't. That is because we are staying at home and the borders are closed,\" tweeted Dr. Firass Abiad, head of the government's Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which has been dealing with the majority of coronavirus cases in Beirut. His tweet linked to a New York Times opinion piece about ventilator shortages in the US.\\n\\nAs of April 9, there are more than 430,000 Covid-19 cases and 14,000 deaths in the US, with 576 cases and 19 fatalities in Lebanon, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.\\n\\nJust under 12,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out so far in Lebanon. That equates to around 0.1% of the population (by contrast, roughly 0.3% of the population in Britain, and 1.1% of the population of Germany have been tested). As a result, the ministry of public health believes it is underestimating the scale of its outbreak. It has urged more people to get tested.\\n\\nLebanon's ministry of public health has vowed to boost the number of screenings to as many as 2,000 a day. It says anyone with mild to severe symptoms is entitled to be tested.\\n\\nIn a recent video address, Director General of the Public Health Ministry Walid Ammar blamed the social stigma around COVID-19 for low levels of screening in the country: \"If a citizen feels that your reaction will be bad, then they won't go and get tested,\" said Ammar. \"You all should be afraid of people who won't get tested because they're afraid of you. These are the people who will infect you.\"\\n\\nMore people are showing up for tests, but the medical sector -- which was dealt a heavy blow by the country's financial crisis -- lacks the resources to conduct mass screenings, medical professionals say.\\n\\nMedics say that the country's proactive lockdown measures have helped the health sector avoid the pandemonium seen in many other countries ravaged by the virus.\\n\\n\"The more we test, the better, but we have to realize that our resources are limited and need to use it strategically,\" tweeted Hassan Zaraket, a virologist and assistant professor at the American University of Beirut. \"If we had been missing many cases we would have explosion at ER & ICU.\"\\n\\nLebanese security forces stop cars at a highway checkpoint north of Beirut on April 6, as authorities implemented further measures restricting the movement of vehicles.\\n\\nWhile it may be too soon to say if the spread of coronavirus will continue to slow, Howland says she has taken comfort in Lebanon's strict measures. \"The government got ahead of the problem and so far (the number of cases) hasn't escalated,\" she says.\\n\\nThe White House's response, she argues, stands in sharp contrast with that of her crisis-ridden adopted country.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump has come under fire for being slow to act in stopping the rapid spread of the disease there. The country now has the highest number of reported cases and deaths from the virus globally, and a prominent model that tracks the coronavirus in the US predicted on Wednesday that more than 60,000 people will die due to Covid-19 by August.\\n\\n\"Watching how Trump has handled this crisis ... it just seems that people are not really aware of what's going on and not taking the proper decisions,\" says Howland.\\n\\nEmployees work while wearing protective face shields and gloves at a store in the northern Lebanese city of Batroun on March 23.\\n\\nFears of long-term pain in Lebanon\\n\\nOthers believe that cash-strapped Lebanon has yet to see the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nWhen Lebanese-American Hana Murr received an email with the US embassy's offer for repatriation last week, she saw it as an opportunity to flee a deepening economic crisis.\\n\\n\"We've always had a weak state and we're going to get affected greatly by that as a result,\" says Murr. \"The government now has to play catch-up. They're doing a pretty decent job. I am surprised. My expectations were very low, and they've exceeded them.\"\\n\\nBut she adds: \"The downward spiral of the economy and the dangers that coronavirus pose make me very afraid, and I want to get out before it all comes to a head.\"\\n\\n\"I'm happy, heartbroken, relieved, depressed and it changes every 10 minutes,\" says Murr, hours before boarding a flight back to her home state of Florida.\\n\\nSpeaking from her Beirut apartment, Montana-native Fuglei says she may have been tempted to return to the US, had she had more faith in its leadership.\\n\\n\"To be honest, if we still had an Obama administration or any kind of confidence then maybe we (Americans in Beirut) would have felt differently,\" she says. \"They probably would have enacted something where I had a clear healthcare plan going back, or where housing was being compensated, or having a clear package of benefits that I could have come back to,\" Fuglei adds.\\n\\n\"I just have zero trust.\"

       "There was a heated disagreement in the White House Situation Room this weekend over the efficacy of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine -- but multiple sources say it was mostly one-sided, as U.S. President Donald Trump's top trade adviser Peter Navarro feuded with other officials over the drug's unproven effectiveness to treat coronavirus.\\n\\nThe debate is not a new one inside the coronavirus task force -- and medical experts have repeatedly explained to the president that there is a risk in enthusiastically touting hydroxychloroquine in case the drug doesn't ultimately work to combat the virus. But other aides and outside advisers have sided with Trump, including Navarro, who is still not a formal part of the task force but has wedged himself into the meetings.\\n\\nAxios first reported on the disagreement inside the White House about the drug.\\n\\nWhile discussing the latest on hydroxychloroquine this weekend, an exasperated Navarro lashed out at Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the advisers who has urged caution about the drug, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN.\\n\\nNavarro had brought a stack of paperwork with him into the Situation Room on the drug, arguing it was proof that it could work to treat coronavirus, which Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, disagreed with because it was not data.\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\" Fauci asked -- a question that set Navarro off. He became indignant, and at one point, accused Fauci of opposing Trump's travel restrictions on China, which confused many in the room, given Fauci was one of the initial few to agree with Trump on the move, the source said.\\n\\nA source close to the task force said Fauci is not backing off his belief that hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment for coronavirus. When CNN's Jeremy Diamond asked Fauci to comment on the matter Sunday night, Trump stepped in and didn't allow Fauci to answer. But a source said the doctor has already offered his opinion on the drug in other venues and would continue to do so.\\n\\nSeveral aides later said they were unfazed by Navarro's outburst, given he has them regularly. But the argument highlights how deep the divide runs over the task force's response to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nAnother source told CNN that despite the disagreement in the Situation Room between Fauci and Navarro, Fauci continues to have a good relationship with Trump and Pence, though some staffers have shown irritation when his opinions differ.\\n\\nAsked about the exchange on CNN's \"New Day\" Monday morning, Navarro claimed he was qualified to engage and disagree with Fauci on coronavirus treatment despite not being a medical doctor.\\n\\n\"Doctors disagree about things all the time. My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I'm a social scientist,\" Navarro said. \"I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\"\\n\\nTrump in recent days has pointed to hydroxychloroquine as a treatment despite scant scientific evidence of the drug's effectiveness.\\n\\nWithout citing evidence, Trump said at Sunday's briefing that hydroxychloroquine is a \"great\" and \"powerful\" anti-malaria drug \"and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs.\"\\n\\nFor people without heart problems, Trump recommended combining hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, a common antibiotic. He said azithromycin \"will kill certain things that you don't want living within your body.\"\\n\\nYet there is little reliable evidence that the drugs -- either alone or in combination -- are effective at treating the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nStill, Trump said: \"What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?\"\\n\\nFor doctors, nurses and first responders, Trump suggested the drugs could be taken as a preventative. \"They say taking it before the fact is good, but what do you have to lose?\"\\n\\nExperts do not suggest taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive for Covid-19 because there is no evidence yet to suggest it protects against contracting the virus.\\n\\n\"They say take it,\" said Trump, without citing any experts or sources. \"I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs.\"\\n\\nTrump also said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave hydroxychloroquine \"rapid approval,\" but in fact, the FDA has not approved it for the treatment of COVID-19.

       "THREAD: The cities that face a growing risk of large epidemics are going to be pressed as many federal resources have been forward deployed to New York, and the federal ability to backstop multiple cities is going to be limited. There are things every city should be doing now.\\n\\nLow census hospitals are still doing elective cases, and consuming supplies. That must end. States must focus resources on urban hospitals and take reasonable steps to reduce activity in community; move available supplies and capacity freed up at community level to urban setting\\n\\nGerm theory will prevail. The virus will be a national epidemic. While we hope some communities will be spared, we should expect urban centers to all be engulfed. Because the virus hasn't reached every city yet; every urban center should prepare as if it will. Many still aren't.

Total 267 persons have recovered so far,\" said Agarwal.\\n\\nThe number of covid-19 cases continues to rise in Andhra Pradesh, with 26 more people testing positive. The total number of cases in the state now stands at 226, and Nellore district has reported the highest number at 34.\\n\\nAs many as 29 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Mumbai, taking the total number to 690 in Maharashtra, the state's health minister Rajesh Tope said. With this, 406 cases have been reported from Mumbai alone, he said.\\n\\nThe government allayed concerns over the spread of the virus through air, clarifying that the infection only transmits via droplets released due to coughing, sneezing and from the breaths of a covid-19 patient.\\n\\n“The coronavirus infection is not airborne but a droplet infection. Had it been an airborne infection, every person in a family of an infected person would have caught the virus because they all would be breathing the infected air by the infected family member. Same would apply for other patients in a hospital. In some cases, scientists have found it in some settings,\" said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\\n\\n“We should go by the evidences in science. In the world there are over million of covid-19, but there is no such evidence,\" he said.\\n\\nThe government also said there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and N95 masks.\\n\\nDomestic manufacturers have started production and the government has started procuring them from other countries.\\n\\n“We've discussed this with all health secretaries, chief secretaries and DMs as this is one of the major issues. We've explained to them that PPEs available with us have been already immediately dispatched to the states based on case-load basis,\" said Agarwal.\\n\\n\"We need to understand we make allotments based on the number of cases reported in states. We are also parallely making an effort to see that how should its procurement be increased. It has started easing out, in coming weeks we should be able to manage these issues to a large extent,\" he added.

       "This story originally appeared in The Guardian and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows.\\n\\nOne expert said the sudden shift represented the “largest-scale experiment ever,” in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.\\n\\nReadings from ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year.\\n\\nNitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma.\\n\\nCourtesy of European Space Agency\\n\\nWhile not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world’s carbon emissions and that drive global heating.\\n\\nPaul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. “We are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,” he said. “Are we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”\\n\\nMonks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.\\n\\n“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization describes NO 2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic meter. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.\\n\\nOne of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to NASA, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central China have been 10 to 30 percent lower than normal.

       "WHO accused of suppressing information about Taiwan's coronavirus prevention measures\\n\\nUpdated\\n\\nAlong with its Asian neighbours South Korea and Singapore, Taiwan has received near-universal praise for its approach to fighting coronavirus.\\n\\nKey points: Taiwan, which has been praised for its COVID-19 response, says WHO is not passing on information it shares with the body\\n\\nTaiwan has been denied observer status at the WHO since 2016\\n\\nCritics say WHO is too influenced by China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory\\n\\nDespite its proximity to China, where the pandemic started, Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control has reported just over 300 cases of coronavirus.\\n\\nOnly two people have died.\\n\\nBy contrast, Australia — which has a similar population — has reported 4,359 cases and 19 deaths.\\n\\nBut despite this, Taiwan's foreign ministry has complained that official data and prevention methods it has provided to the World Health Organisation (WHO) are not being shared with the international body's member states.\\n\\nWHO membership is only open to members of the United Nations, and Taiwan was voted out of the UN in favour of the People's Republic of China in 1971.\\n\\nA controversial interview with Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general at the WHO, has brought the issue of Taiwan's inclusion into focus once again.\\n\\nTaiwan's fight against the coronavirus\\n\\nAfter its first case of COVID-19 was detected in January, Taiwan's Government adopted an aggressive approach to screening international arrivals and contact tracing those infected.\\n\\nPrimed for the outbreak of an infectious disease by the SARS crisis of 2003, the Government's adoption of swift and decisive measures appear to have limited the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nTaiwan introduced harsh penalties for those breaking home quarantine, introducing fines of up to $53,000.\\n\\n\"About 58 per cent of all confirmed cases in Taiwan were believed to have resulted from local transmission,\" Benjamin J Cowling, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in the New York Times.\\n\\n\"This is an important marker of success for Taiwan's containment strategy: In many other places, local cases outnumbered imported infections by a far greater margin.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, Taiwan's foreign ministry this week said WHO was not sharing information provided by Taipei to its member states.\\n\\n\"Therefore, the health bodies of various countries cannot understand the current situation of Taiwan's epidemic situation, preventive policies and border quarantine measures from the information provided by the WHO,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.\\n\\nMs Ou called on the body to \"continue to review and improve upon some unreasonable restrictions imposed on Taiwan based on political considerations\".\\n\\nThe WHO has said it is closely following coronavirus developments, including lessons learned in Taiwan, \"to share best practices globally\".\\n\\nPush for inclusion of Taiwan in WHO\\n\\nWorld leaders as prominent as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Canada's Justin Trudeau have called for WHO to grant Taiwan full membership.\\n\\nThe US State Department has also campaigned strongly for WHO to allow Taiwan a place at the table.\\n\\nThe WHO ended Taiwan's observer status at its annual meetings — the World Health Assembly — in 2016.\\n\\nAt China's behest, Taiwanese officials were allowed to attend this year's forum in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nCritics say the WHO is too deferential to Beijing, which under the so-called One China policy considers Taiwan part of its territory.\\n\\nWen-Ti Sung, a political scientist from the Australian National University, told the ABC China's funding for UN agencies such as WHO made it relatively immune to criticism.\\n\\n\"It makes sense then for WHO to avoid direct criticism of China which could lead to defunding, underfunding or sudden suspension of certain WHO-backed programs,\" he said\\n\\nAsked last week by Hong Kong's RTHK network whether it would consider granting Taiwan membership, the WHO's Dr Aylward said he did not hear the reporter's question.\\n\\nDr Aylward, who is also co-leader of WHO's joint mission on COVID-19 in China, then appeared to end the interview and turn his computer off.\\n\\nCriticised over the interview, WHO released a rare statement on Taiwan, stating \"the question of Taiwanese membership in WHO is up to WHO member states, not WHO staff\".\\n\\n\"However, WHO is working closely with all health authorities who are facing the current coronavirus pandemic, including Taiwanese health experts,\" it said.\\n\\n\"The Taiwanese caseload is low relative to population … WHO is taking lessons learned from all areas, including Taiwanese health authorities, to share best practices globally.\"\\n\\nUS support for Taiwan strengthened\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has heightened diplomatic tensions between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nBeijing has been saying it has the coronavirus outbreak under control, and it has sought to promote a positive image of its official response abroad.\\n\\nSenior Chinese officials and state media have even actively promoted conspiracy theories, including that the disease originated in the United States or Italy, rather than China.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has angered Beijing by referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\".\\n\\nLast week, the Trump Administration signed into law an act which requires the State Department to push allies of Taiwan not to cut diplomatic ties.\\n\\nThe Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act calls for the strengthening of ties with Taiwan.\\n\\nIt also seeks to \"alter\" economic, security and diplomatic relations with countries that choose to \"undermine the security or prosperity of Taiwan\".\\n\\nSeveral Pacific states last year severed ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing, meaning it now only has full diplomatic relations with 15 countries around the world, but \"substantive ties\" with several others including Australia and the US.\\n\\nThe TAIPEI Act also reiterates Washington's commitment to advocate for Taiwan's full inclusion in international organisations such as WHO.\\n\\nEric Li-Luan Chu, a former mayor of New Taipei City and a prominent figure in the Chinese Nationalist Party, wrote in February \"it is time for the WHO to put politics aside and think about what is good for world health\".\\n\\nFor Mr Sung, the potential consequences of coronavirus extend far beyond public health.\\n\\n\"Taiwan as one of the liberal democracies in Asia … has been doing exceptionally well on the containment of coronavirus,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If the Trump administration fails spectacularly once again … it will deal quite a bad blow to Western liberal democracy.\"\\n\\nTopics: covid-19,

       "At Office Depot, employees have been told that they cannot wear masks in the store. Some Walgreens workers say they were also discouraged from wearing them. Many other large retailers, including Target, have started to allow masks, but are leaving it up to employees to procure their own supplies.\\n\\nFederal health officials appear ready to recommend that Americans of all ages start wearing masks for protection against the coronavirus, but millions of retail workers have been interacting with the public for weeks without them. Sometimes, they have been told that wearing masks could scare shoppers. Now many are scrambling to find available gear.\\n\\nThe retailers’ different positions on masks, which follow those of the government, are indicative of how the industry has been fumbling through the fast-moving pandemic, potentially endangering workers. The restrictions could also increase the risk that their stores, which are virtually the only places where the public can still congregate, could be contributing to the spread of the virus.\\n\\nProtective gear has become a point of contention in the increasingly tense environment at grocery and big-box stores. This week, workers at Amazon and Instacart staged protests over working conditions during the pandemic, and walkouts are planned at other major retailers in the coming days. Many retailers are being pressured to take even more precautions than regulators have advised.

       "Anthony Fauci at a coronavirus briefing. | AP Photo Fauci: Mask-wearing recommendation under 'very serious consideration'\\n\\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, revealed on Tuesday that the White House coronavirus task force is seriously considering guidance that all Americans wear masks to help thwart the spread of the disease.\\n\\nBut Fauci also acknowledged that such a directive has been complicated by the nationwide dearth of personal protective equipment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"The idea of getting a much more broad, communitywide use of masks outside of the health care setting is under very active discussion at the task force. The CDC group is looking at that very carefully,\" Fauci told CNN.\\n\\n\"The thing that has inhibited that a bit is to make sure that we don't take away the supply of masks from the health care workers who need them,\" he continued. \"But once we get in a situation where we have enough masks, I believe there will be some very serious consideration about more broadening this recommendation of using masks.\"\\n\\n\"We're not there yet,\" Fauci cautioned, but he said he believed the task force was \"close to coming to some determination\" on whether to expand the administration's recommended mitigation measures to include masks.\\n\\n\"Because if, in fact, a person who may or may not be infected wants to prevent infecting someone else, one of the best ways to do that is with a mask. So perhaps that's the way to go,\" he said, adding that the subject was \"under very active consideration\" and would be raised at the task force meeting Tuesday afternoon.\\n\\nSome public health experts, including former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner and informal administration adviser Scott Gottlieb, have suggested that encouraging the wearing of masks in public could help curb the rapid rate of Covid-19 infection in the United States.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday said he had taken note of the proposal, outlined in a recent report Gottlieb co-authored, and that it could be possible that Americans will be directed to wear masks \"for a short period of time.\"\\n\\n\"We'll take a look at it. For a period of time, not forever. I mean, you know, we want our country back. We're not going to be wearing masks forever,\" Trump said at the task force's daily news briefing.\\n\\nThe president also told reporters that \"we're getting certainly the number of masks that you'd need\" to implement the guidance — an assessment with which Fauci appeared to disagree on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"You don't want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing we do. If we have them covered, then you could look back and say, 'Maybe we need to broaden this.'\"

       "\\n\\nChris Fox, CP24.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToronto’s top doctor says that residents will likely have to remain at home and only venture outside “for the most essential of needs” for the next 12 weeks amid a surging number of cases of COVID-19 locally that has placed the city on an alarming trajectory.\\n\\nDr. Eileen de Villa made the comment on Wednesday as she issued sweeping new recommendations to help limit the spread of COVID-19., recommendations that Mayor John Tory says amount to “locking the city down as much as any municipal government possibly could.”\\n\\nDe Villa said that she is recommending “in the strongest possible terms” that all Torontonians remain in their homes, except for medical appointments, to shop for groceries no more than once a week or to walk their dogs or get exercise.\\n\\nShe said that she is also using her powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act to order all individuals with COVID-19 to remain home for 14 days. As well, she is ordering close contacts of people with the virus to likewise self-isolate for a period of 14 days.\\n\\n“It is my belief that these measures need to be in place for up to 12 weeks. But I would tell you that how long these measures need to be in place and how successful we are in terms of controlling the virus spread is entirely in our hands,” she said. “The more we are able to put these measures into place and the more we are able as a community to adhere to these recommendations the shorter will be the duration of these measures and the more effective we will be at reducing the loss of lives in our community.”\\n\\nDe Villa said that there have been 628 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the city as of yesterday and 165 probable cases, including 33 that have required treatment in an intensive care unit.\\n\\nWhile the city is yet to see the sort of caseloads that have been reported in places like New York City, where more than 1,100 people have died after contracting the virus, de Villa said that the numbers are headed in the wrong direction with the city experiencing a roughly 500 per cent increase in confirmed cases over the last two weeks.\\n\\n“This is not a favourable trajectory and as your medical officer of health I am deeply concerned,” she said. “I realize I depict a very stark picture here. A very stark picture but is one that is honest and true. Given this is our current situation it is my belief that we must absolutely implement stronger measures to avoid the type of results we are seeing in places like New York City.”\\n\\n‘A very long battle’\\n\\nThe City of Toronto had previously cancelled the permits for all major events and festivals through June 30, though de Villa’s recommendations further reinforce the fact that life as we know it could look different for some time.\\n\\nSpeaking directly to Torontonians during Wednesday’s news conference, Mayor John Tory said that the number of COVID-19 cases in the city are headed in “the wrong direction” and it is now “absolutely clear that this is going to be a very long battle.”\\n\\n“I believe most people want this over as soon as possible and if given the choice they will do what it takes to end this situation at the earliest possible date which being candid likely does mean the 12 weeks referred to by Dr. de Villa,” he said. “You want to go and visit and give a hug to your mother or grandmother as soon as you can, you want to go to a restaurant and sit on the patio and have a beer, you want to watch your kids once again able to play on a playground without restriction and you want to go to a Blue Jays game or hang out on the beach with friends but getting to those better days will depend on our collective response as a city. We have it in our control to make those better days come sooner.”\\n\\nThe Province of Ontario has already ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses through April 13 and has also prohibited any organized gatherings of five or more people.\\n\\nTory said that the recommendations made by de-Villa “give us the best possible chance of avoiding a fate such as that being experienced in New York City” but he conceded that they are “strong medicine.”\\n\\nHe added that while other levels of government could put more restrictive shelter-in-place orders in place, the city has now done almost everything it can do “within the powers and authorities of a municipal government to address the spread of the virus.”\\n\\n“This is a tough day and there will be many tough days ahead but we will deal with those tough days starting today and push through so that we can avoid really dark days,” he said. “This city gives me hope every single day. There are things that go on in this city that give you hope every single day without exception, even today when some things may look bleak. I want today’s announcement to give you hope, I want for us to give hope to each other and I promise you that if we know what we have to do and we do what we know we have to do then we will emerge stronger and better than ever.\"\\n\\nTory has asked that bylaw be drafted to enforce social distancing\\n\\nDe Villa’s recommendations do not come in the form of orders but she said that she believes she is using the powers available to her to “the fullest extent possible,” something that has been backed up by legal counsel.\\n\\nFor his part, Tory said that he has asked staff to draft a bylaw to “enforce social distancing limits.”\\n\\nHe said that he doesn’t believe that bylaw needs to be put into place at this moment but warned that it could be introduced should concerns persist around people carrying on with their lives as normal amid the pandemic.\\n\\nPast that the city may not have many measures left in its toolbox, as Tory pointed out that de Villa’s latest recommendations mean that city hall has now done almost everything it can do “within the powers and authorities of a municipal government to address the spread of the virus.”\\n\\n“Of course it (the bylaw) could apply only to city property but that is a large part of the city and includes the sidewalks, the streets, the parks and different places like that,” he said. “Of course any bylaw does have to contain some sanctions in the event that people don’t follow it and of course there would have to be some enforcement. But again, our strong wish is that we should police ourselves and make sure we are all doing what we are being asked to do. I just hope that we don’t need to pass a bylaw that tells people the obvious.”\\n\\nTory has previously raised concerns about large crowds of people continuing to gather in parks and along the city’s waterfront.

       "Two competing epidemiological models currently guide and divide expert opinion on how best to respond to the novel coronavirus. The first, from Imperial College London, scared the U.S. and British governments into instituting strict social-distancing measures. It predicted that if left unchecked, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, could kill over half a million people in the United Kingdom and 2.2 million in the United States—not counting the many additional deaths caused by the collapse of each country’s health-care system. The second model, developed by researchers at Oxford University, suggested that the virus had already infected as much as 40 percent of the British population but that most had shown mild or no symptoms. According to this model, COVID-19 would still cause many deaths, and it would still severely stress health-care systems. But because it predicted fewer critical cases to come, the Oxford model suggested that an indefinite lockdown might not be necessary.\\n\\nThe attractions of the Oxford model are obvious. But if political leaders plan based on the Oxford model and turn out to be living in a world described by the Imperial College London model, they will have made a bad situation much, much worse.\\n\\nSimilarly, high-stakes decisions must be made about how to protect national economies from the effects of COVID-19—decisions that can be predicted with another kind of model. Political economists use “growth models” to describe what countries do to promote growth under normal circumstances, but these models also indicate how countries are likely to respond in the event of a crisis, such as a deadly pandemic. The United Kingdom’s basic growth model, for example, is driven by finance, housing, and, above all, domestic consumption. When the British economy got walloped by the coronavirus crisis and everyone was told to stay home, taking measures to boost consumption—such as guaranteeing 80 percent of wages—was the necessary response. By contrast, in Germany, which is essentially a giant export platform sucking in demand from elsewhere, the necessary response included instituting a shorter workweek and guaranteeing company balance sheets, but not supporting wages.\\n\\nPolitical economists use “growth models” to describe what countries do to promote growth under normal circumstances, but these models also indicate how countries are likely to respond in the event of a crisis.\\n\\nFor the United States, the question of how best to shield the economy from the effects of the pandemic is more complicated. In growth model terms, the United States is a massive exporter of primary products, aircraft, weapons, oil, services, software, e-commerce, and finance—simply because its economy represents a quarter of global GDP. But most of what drives the U.S. economy is still domestic consumption, and while that isn’t as credit-driven or debt dependent as some analysts have claimed—the United States lies in the middle of the pack of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of the ratio of household debt to household income—the role that private-sector debt plays in the U.S. economy makes it difficult to respond to a crisis like this one. This reality is thrown into sharp relief when contrasting the U.S. growth model with those of other countries.\\n\\nBLUNTING THE SHOCK\\n\\nTrade-dependent growth models, such as those found in northern and western Europe, tend to have large welfare states that act as “shock absorbers,” helping to mitigate the effects of economic shocks. In general, the more open a European country’s economy is to international trade, the bigger the welfare state it constructs to act as a buffer in case trade shuts off. Large welfare states also allow their citizens to carry large amounts of debt, since they effectively insure them against periods of unemployment; the most indebted people in the world are not Americans but the Danes and the Dutch.\\n\\nIn contrast, countries with growth models of the Anglo-American variety, especially the United States, tend to have weaker states, lower taxes, and large financial sectors. They have highly flexible labor markets rather than large welfare states, which means they ultimately depend on wages to drive growth. Since those wages have been buying less and less over time, credit cards, student loans, and medical debts have become a standard part of U.S. household budgeting. When those household budgets shrink sharply, their debts are not compensated by the shock absorbers that countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany have in place.\\n\\nThis lack of shock absorbers is integral to the U.S. growth model, and under normal circumstances, it is a feature, not a bug. When systems such as the American one are hit by shocks, they tend to bail out their financial systems to keep credit flowing and let the real economy absorb the blow through unemployment and austerity policies. The assumption is that with no shock absorbers in place, prices and wages will adjust quickly, capital will be redeployed, and growth will return without the need for state intervention. But these are not normal circumstances. And as U.S. policymakers are quickly realizing, the usual playbook is of limited use in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nDISASTER, AMPLIFIED\\n\\nDuring a global economic crisis, the United States has one major advantage over other countries: it prints the global reserve currency. Other countries need U.S. dollars because their banking systems lend in dollars even though they can’t print them. During previous crises such as the 2008 financial crisis, sharp falls in global financial markets have been put right by Federal Reserve actions such as rate cuts and bond-buying programs. But this time, Federal Reserve action has not had its usual calming effect: financial markets have continued to fall, and the dollar’s dominance has failed to prevent a flight into cash. Although Congress finally passed a $2 trillion economic stabilization package, its continuing inability to agree on whom to bail out—companies or consumers—reflects tensions in the underlying growth model. The United States typically opts to protect capital and to simply let labor adjust through unemployment. But this instinct—to protect the big players and let workers take the hit—is also a key reason why the coronavirus pandemic is a disaster amplifier for the U.S. growth model in a way that is not true for Germany or even the United Kingdom.\\n\\nAmerican policymakers’ instinct to protect the big players and let workers take the hit is a key reason why the coronavirus pandemic is a disaster amplifier for the United States.\\n\\nThe U.S. growth model works well as long as there is little unemployment, wages are being earned and spent, and credit is being recycled to cover the difference between wages and costs by consumers and companies. But when markets freeze and cannot price assets correctly (no one knows how much United Airlines stock is worth because they don’t know when Americans will be flying again), the growth model collapses. Once that happens, it is hard to find a bottom. The Federal Reserve and Congress can try to put a floor on asset prices by bailing out companies, but there is no bottom for the broader crisis of consumption that occurs when a third of the labor market is laid off and the other two-thirds are locked at home for an extended period of time. In this world, bailing out capital and expecting labor to adjust through wage cuts and unemployment is simply impossible given the scale of the shutdown.\\n\\nThe U.S. growth model is built in such a way that it simply cannot shut down without inflicting catastrophic damage on itself. Because the model is designed to adjust through reduced wages and employment rather than increased welfare outlays, political leaders can contemplate temporary unemployment benefits for a banking-induced shock, but not semipermanent cash transfers—which is what the British are doing—and a near-total collapse in asset values. The British solution is too politically toxic to be anything other than a short-term expedient in the American context. So, once it became clear that—at least according to the Imperial College London model—the epidemiologically correct response was to put the economy in hibernation for several months, U.S. leaders started looking for other solutions.\\n\\nOne alternative solution, put forth by U.S. President Donald Trump but with proponents in many states, is to simply “restart the economy.” The direct cost of doing so, according to the Imperial College London model, could be the deaths of as many as 2.2 million Americans—or, as Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick bluntly suggested in a recent interview, old people need to die to save the economy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, even if Americans turn out to be living in the world described by the less dire Oxford model, simply restarting the economy may not be feasible if that means up to 70 percent of Americans will catch a disease that requires intensive care in over ten percent of cases. If Americans return to work, these infection rates would effectively shut down labor markets whether the president likes it or not. Consumers are unlikely to flock to malls when they could literally “shop till they drop,” and businesses whose employees are crowding emergency rooms are unlikely to invest in products they would be unable to ship.\\n\\nThe United States, with its 330 million people, 270 million handguns, 80 million hourly workers with no statutory sick pay, and 28 million medically uninsured, faces challenges quite unlike those in other countries. Putting the economy in a freezer for six months or longer would destroy what’s left of its social fabric along with its growth model. But restarting it could turn the pandemic into a plague that could cause as much damage as the freezer.\\n\\nABANDONING THE LOCKDOWN

       "JPMorgan says food companies have started to talk about reducing the number of promotions they offer, and Mondelez International Inc., Kellogg Co. and plenty of other businesses stand to benefit.\\n\\nWith people across the U.S. staying home more, diners are eating in, sending flocks of shoppers to retailers like Kroger Co. KR, -2.36% , Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, -0.48% , Walmart Inc. WMT, -3.23% and others.\\n\\nThough shoppers may be done with their initial stockpiling, which sent sales of grocery and household necessities soaring in March, analysts say they’ll likely maintain shopping activity to replenish essential items.\\n\\nRead:Traffic at Walmart, Costco and Target falls or the first time in weeks as coronavirus stockpiling behavior shifts\\n\\nBMO Equity Research data shows that grocery sales grew 83% for the two weeks ending March 22. Sales were up a whopping 89% for the week ending March 15 and up 77% for the week ending March 22.\\n\\nIn a note published Friday, JPMorgan analysts said 22% of food on store shelves is discounted, according to the companies under its coverage, and the average discount is 23%. Retail sales would increase 5% if all discounts went away.\\n\\n“In a normal environment, reduced discounts — that is, higher prices — would lead to lower volumes, but we are not in normal times,” JPMorgan said. “We think elasticity will be minimal as long as food-at-home is benefiting from COVID-19 to this degree.”\\n\\nAnalysts noted that J.M. Smucker Co. SJM, -1.13% has already announced that it will be cutting discounts, saying in a March 19 letter to retailers that terminating promotions scheduled to start between April 17 and Nov. 30 is one of the measures it’s taking to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nSee: A record number of Americans are losing their jobs -- but Amazon, Walmart and Ace Hardware and others are hiring to fill 479,000 opening amid coronavirus\\n\\nConagra Brands Inc. CAG, -2.71% has said it’s working with its retail customers on cutting discounts as well.\\n\\n“What I would tell you on promotions right now is, we’re honoring all the contracts we have in place,” said Conagra Chief Executive Sean Connolly on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on March 31, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n“But the tactical dynamic is that we’re in daily discussions with our customers on how to help them meet the needs of their shoppers. And many customers are looking to pull back on promotions as they try to manage the basics of just keeping their shelves stocked.”\\n\\nIn addition to Mondelez and Kellogg, JPMorgan said Kraft Heinz Co. KHC, +2.70% , Campbell Soup Co. CPB, -1.82% and Kroger will be among the companies that gain the most from reducing discounts.\\n\\n“Over the last four- and two-week periods, the percentage of food-at-products sold on deal has started to decline year-over-year,” the analysts wrote.\\n\\nWatch:Can companies keep up with the new demand of online grocery shopping?\\n\\nGrocers aren’t the only ones cutting promotions to keep shoppers from rushing the shelves. Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.50% said it has canceled all major spring promotions to keep from driving traffic to its stores, part of its social-distancing efforts.\\n\\nS&P Global Ratings also identifies certain categories, like shelf-stable foods and household cleaners, as well-positioned for the coronavirus pandemic and volatile capital markets.\\n\\n“The initial spike in demand from pantry-loading and consumers replenishing at a rapid rate because of the shift to at-home consumption gives manufacturers of staple items an advantage,” S&P said.

And, when you have Dr. Fauci -- and I understand he's not an economist. I understand he's just looking at it from a public health point of view,\" he advised. \" But, if we don't have public health, then we're never going to restart the economy.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" Wallace continued, \"you know, if you loosen the reins too quickly, then people are going to go back to restaurants or people are going to go to sporting events and then the virus is going to come back with a fury.\"\\n\\nDuring a briefing in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted there will be another COVID-19 outbreak in the fall, but expects the United States to be better prepared to combat the threat.\\n\\n“In fact, I would anticipate that that would actually happen because of the degree of transmissibility,” he added.\\n\\n“Our ability to go out and be able to test, identify, isolate, and contact trace, will be orders of magnitude better than what it was just a couple months ago,” Fauci told reporters.\\n\\n\"Look, we all know it's painful,\" Wallace commented. \"But, you know, if we go through this for a month or two months and then let our foot off the pedal and people go back and we get a second wave, it's going to be much worse.\"\\n\\nWallace told host Brian Kilmeade it was better to be overly cautious than rush to normalcy.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"I mean, look at the president. The president was talking about Easter and then, you know, he got the facts, he got these models and he went, 'No, we're not going to do that. We're going to extend the guidelines for a month till the end of April,'\" he mused. \"And, people are saying it shouldn't just be a state-by-state lockdown it should be a national lockdown.\"\\n\\n\"I don't think you can rush the facts and this, yes, it has economic implications — serious economic implications. But, this is ultimately a public health crisis. You've got to solve that first,\" Wallace concluded.

       "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Los Angeles on Wednesday told everyone in the nation’s second-largest city to start wearing masks to combat the coronavirus, but California’s governor isn’t ready to take that idea statewide.\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he’s focused instead on keeping people inside. He also announced the state may need 66,000 additional hospital beds, 16,000 more than previously forecast, to handle the crush of illnesses expected during the second part of May.\\n\\nAt an afternoon news conference, Mayor Eric Garcetti said he had been awaiting advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on mask-wearing but with the COVID-19 rate surging had decided to wait no longer.\\n\\nThe mayor said all 4 million residents who are performing essential tasks such as food shopping should wear homemade, non-medical face coverings, or even bandannas, as people in other COVID-19-struck countries have done.\\n\\n“To be clear, you should still stay at home. This isn’t an excuse to suddenly all go out,\" Garcetti said.\\n\\nHe also said people shouldn't use medical-grade masks, which are in short supply and are needed by health care workers and first responders.\\n\\nThe mayor said even a “tucked-in bandanna” could slow the spread of the virus and the masks also are good for reminding people to keep their distance.\\n\\n“I know it will look surreal,” he said, donning a mask. “We’re going to have to get used to seeing each other like this ... This will be the look.”\\n\\nLos Angeles County reported more than 500 new cases on Wednesday, a 17% hike over the previous day.\\n\\nGarcetti's announcement came after Riverside County public health officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser urged that people who need to go out in public should use something — even bandanas or neck warmers — to cover their mouths and noses to protect others and themselves.\\n\\nThe governor had been expected to release guidelines for masks, but at his own news conference Newsom said he did not think they should be a substitute for keeping a safe distance from other people and taking additional measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\\n\\n“They are not a substitute for a stay-at-home order. They are not a call to get folks to find N95 masks or surgical masks and pull them away or compete against our first responders,\" Newsom said.\\n\\nNewsom focused instead on adding thousands more hospital beds than previously stated. He now projects needing 66,000 more hospital beds for the anticipated peak of cases in late May — 16,000 more than his prior projections.\\n\\nIn Riverside County, Kaiser said the virus is transmitted in droplets that can be spread through coughs or sneezes, so some type of covering could help even if it's not a hospital-grade mask.\\n\\nKaiser issued the recommendation because the state's fourth-largest county was seeing infections rise faster than predicted. At the current rate, he said Wednesday that it would run out of hospital beds April 12 and ventilators by April 26.\\n\\n“When the situation changes, the rule book changes,” Kaiser said in a news release. “We’re seeing our numbers increasing even sooner than we predicted, and that means our strategy must change too.”\\n\\nU.S. and global health authorities have said people who are not health care workers shouldn't wear a mask unless they're sick — to prevent infecting others.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization recommended people caring for a sick relative wear a mask. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agreed — as long as the person who was ill was not able to wear a mask.\\n\\nBut there has been some conflicting direction. Austria said this week it would require masks for grocery shoppers. President Donald Trump suggested people who are worried should wear a scarf.\\n\\nCalifornia's public health officer, Dr. Sonia Angell, said face coverings could prevent the spread of the virus, but if worn incorrectly or handled improperly could lead to infection. They could also lead people to let down their guard and not stay the recommended distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from others.\\n\\n“When we speak about the potential downfalls, which we also must acknowledge, they can be that if people have these masks on, they feel somewhat immune, they feel like they can get closer to other people,\" Angell said.\\n\\nThe spread of the virus statewide has, so far, been slow enough to give the state time to prepare for an expected spike in cases that could overwhelm hospitals if extreme measures aren't taken to keep most people home and away from others.\\n\\nThe state had nearly 10,000 virus cases and 215 deaths reported Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is keeping a global tally.\\n\\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\\n\\nNewsom has been talking in the past week about increasing hospital beds in the state by two-thirds to add 50,000 new beds at locations that could include convention centers and arenas to cope with peak demand next month. On Wednesday, he increased that number.\\n\\n“Modeling shows we’ll need roughly 66,000 beds towards the end of May,” Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, said at a news conference with the governor.\\n\\nNewsom had bad news for parents Wednesday when he said schools should plan to teach from afar for the rest of the academic year.\\n\\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond provided similar guidance to districts Tuesday evening. The decision on whether students will return to the classroom will ultimately be up to school districts.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento and Christopher Weber in

       "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.\\n\\nWHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.\\n\\nCan the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?\\n\\nStudies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”\\n\\nCan CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?\\n\\nThe main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.\\n\\nCan I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?\\n\\nThe risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.

       "Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Friday \"most of the country\" will not be able to reopen by May 1, despite suggestions from some Trump administration officials that next month may be a time to revisit strict social distancing guidelines.\\n\\n\"Once we get past this thirty days, some places around the country can think about reopening,\" Adams said on Fox News, referring to the 30-day period for the White House social distancing guidelines.\\n\\nAsked about Dr. Anthony Fauci's comments about maintaining social distancing restrictions, Adams said, \"now is the time to continue to lean into this (social distancing).\"\\n\\n\"There are places around the country that have seen consistently low levels, and as we ramp up testing and can feel more confident that these places actually can do surveillance, and can do public health follow-up, some places will be able to think about opening on May 1,\" he said. \"Most of the country will not, to be honest with you, but some will.\"\\n\\n\"That's how we'll reopen the country. Place by place, bit by bit, based on the data,\" he said.\\n\\nAdams expressed concern about the effects of social distancing on other health issues.\\n\\n\"Yes, social distancing is good to stop the spread of COVID, but we know that isolation is bad for almost every other disease you can name out there — depression, domestic violence, heart disease, substance abuse — all these things are worse,\" Adams said.\\n\\nPelosi:Speaker says Trump will only 'make matters worse' if he reopens the country too quickly\\n\\nTrump ad:President's campaign takes heat for ad suggesting former Wash. governor is a Chinese official\\n\\nAdams' comments come as some Trump administration officials have said parts of the country could reopen by May. Attorney General William Barr called the restrictions \"draconian\" in a Wednesday Fox News interview and suggested they should be reevaluated next month, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday on CNBC parts of the economy could reopen in May if Trump was satisfied with medical conditions.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Thursday interview with Politico that Trump might \"make matters worse\" if he reopens the country too soon.\\n\\nAsked in Thursday's coronavirus press briefing what criteria might be used to reopen the government and the country, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters, \"it really varies differently. So I don't think there's one medical criteria.\" He noted that reopening a huge metropolitan area like New York City would be different from that of a town in the Midwest or in the mountain regions.

       "Philadelphia scrapped plans to reopen an empty hospital that could house nearly 500 patients amid the coronavirus pandemic after its owner demanded the city pay him nearly $1 million per month.\\n\\nThe city hoped to use the shuttered Hahnemann University Hospital as it raced to find available beds to handle the rising number of patients with the coronavirus. Philadelphia has been one of the hardest-hit cities, reporting more than 1,300 confirmed cases and 14 deaths.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBut the hospital will remain empty after owner Joel Freedman, a California real estate investor, demanded that the city either buy the property or pay him almost $1 million per month in rent and other costs, according to The New York Times.\\n\\nThe hospital shut down in September 2019 after suffering millions of dollars in losses.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Freedman argued that the costs were far less than what two hospitals in California charged to use those facilities.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n\"Anyone looking at the apples-to-apples comparison can see that Mr. Freedman not only desired to be helpful to the city of Philadelphia and its leaders, but he was very reasonable,\" spokesman Sam Singer told the outlet. \"We're disappointed that they didn't accept what we offered, but we stand ready to be helpful to the city or the state if they want to reopen discussions.\"\\n\\nFreeman's position drew widespread condemnation as the city grapples with an unprecedented health crisis. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rallied his supporters outside of the hospital last year to oppose its closure in one of the city's poorest areas.\\n\\n\"As all of you know, the possible closing of Hahnemann has nothing to do with health care. It has everything to do with greed,\" Sanders said at the time. \"That is wrong, that is immoral, that is not what this country is about.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nSanders renewed his criticism of Freedman as the coronavirus struck Philadelphia.\\n\\n\"We are facing estimates of over 100,000 coronavirus deaths. It is outrageous that a Philadelphia real estate investor who closed a hospital is now trying to gouge the city to re-open it,\" Sanders said, urging the city to take over the hospital. \"The city should reopen Hahnemann hospital immediately.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nSinger claimed that Freedman's opponents have been \"wrongly been critical\" of him.\\n\\nBut Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told reporters last week that the city gave up negotiating with Freedman after Temple University allowed the city to use its music and sports venue free of charge.\\n\\n\"We don't have the need to own it nor the resources to buy it,\" he said. \"So we are done, and we are moving on.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nKenney said the city offered to lease the hospital for a \"nominal\" amount and cover maintenance and expenses. The deal would have paid Freedman \"hundreds of thousands of dollars a month\" and increase the value by doing \"extensive work to make it usable again.\"\\n\\n\"Yet the owner would not agree to our offer,\" he said.\\n\\nBut Freedman demanded far more than the city was able to give, according to Kenney.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n\"I'll let others decide whether that's reasonable or not,\" he added.\\n\\nBrian Abernathy, the city's managing director, told reporters that Freedman's demands were \"unreasonable.\"\\n\\n\"I think he's looking at this as a business transaction rather than providing an imminent and important aid to the city and our residents,\" he said.\\n\\nLawmakers like City Councilor Helen Gym called for the city to use eminent domain to seize the property and not let \"unconscionable greed to get in the way of saving lives.\" But Kenney argued that the option would take too long and would still require them to buy the building at market price.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nKenney said Freedman's position was an example of profiteering that ignored the magnitude of the current crisis.\\n\\n\"People will take advantage of this, trying to make a buck out of this, and I think again it's sad,\" he said. \"This is probably the biggest health crisis in our generation, and they should act accordingly.\"\\n\\nFreedman's property in Philadelphia was vandalized Monday with spray-painted messages reading, \"Joel Kills\" and \"Free Hahnemann.\"\\n\\n\"Joel Freedman has blood on his hands,\" said a flier tacked to the door.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n\"Vandalism or hate is never acceptable, nor will it solve any problems. Rather, it is a time to come together and work collectively for the best of the community,\" Singer told The Philadelphia Inquirer. \"That is what Mr. Freedman attempted to do, and the city determined the site was not suitable for its needs.\"\\n\\nKenney disputed that characterization in a Sunday interview with NPR on.\\n\\n\"We had to go back and forth . . . with a multi-millionaire owner who wanted to maximize his profits,\" he said. \"So we decided — rather than continue to go back and forth with him — we moved on.\"

       "The world soared past the 1 million mark in confirmed coronavirus cases, jobless numbers skyrocketed, Democrats delayed their national convention and the nation's preeminent infectious disease expert required a security detail as the COVID-19 death toll stretched beyond 5,600 in the U.S. on Thursday.\\n\\nMore than 1,000 people died of the coronavirus in the U.S. on Wednesday. A week ago the total was less than 1,300. President Donald Trump and federal health officials predicted a “very painful” period in the country's fight against the public health emergency.\\n\\nOf the globe's 1 million-plus cases, nearly one fourth -- more than 236,000 -- are in the U.S.\\n\\nJobless numbers released Thursday were stunning.

Cases not tested would include asymptomatic individuals, people who may have died of complications of the virus without anyone knowing it, and those whose symptoms were not serious enough to qualify for testing.\\n\\n\"The million (cases) is clearly way under what the actual number will be,'' said Dr. Steven Corwin, president and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\\n\\nHe said the U.S. figures are especially underreported \"because of the lag that we had getting testing underway and the ability to only test the sickest of patients to begin with.''\\n\\n-- Doug Stanglin\\n\\nJobless claims double from last week\\n\\nThe number of Americans who filed claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record 3.3 million last week, and that figure doubled this week when the Labor Department reported 6.6 million claims as the coronavirus pandemic continued to spark massive layoffs and furloughs across the nation.

The event, originally scheduled for July 13-17 in Milwaukee, will instead be held the week of Aug. 17. It's unclear how many days the convention will last as planning remains in flux.\\n\\nAfter \"giving thought to how it is this event can have the greatest impact in the electoral process and the greatest impact in terms of what we can bring to Milwaukee, we felt the best decision, not knowing all the answers, was to delay this,\" Democratic National Convention CEO Joe Solmonese said. The GOP convention is set for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, North Carolina.\\n\\n– Bill Glauber, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\\n\\nDr. Fauci threatened, gets security detail\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been the target of online threats and has been issued an armed security detail, multiple media sources reported Thursday.

Known as mortuary pouches, the heavy-duty zippered bags are typically used in the military to contain the remains of troops killed in combat. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 5,000, and federal health officials have warned it could reach 100,000 or more before the crisis passes.\\n\\nSpokesman Michael Andrews said the Pentagon is responding to \"FEMA's prudent planning efforts on behalf of state health agencies.\"\\n\\n– Tom Vanden Brook\\n\\nFBI seizes 'hoarded' masks, PPE equipment\\n\\nPersonal protective equipment, including almost 200,000 N95 respirator masks, were seized by the FBI's Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force and will be distributed to health care workers battling the pandemic in New York and New Jersey, federal officials said.

Andrew Cuomo warned Thursday. \"At current burn rate, we have about six days of ventilators in our stockpile,\" he said. He added some \"good news\" – the number of patients discharged from New York hospitals rose sharply Wednesday, although it remained short of patients being admitted.\\n\\nThere were 7,434 coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals in the state, up 21% from Tuesday. Cuomo said there were 13,383 people currently hospitalized, an increase of 1,157 (9.5%) from a day earlier. The state had 92,381 confirmed cases and 2,373 deaths as of Thursday morning, he said.\\n\\nPatchwork of orders hard to enforce\\n\\nThere's a struggle across the U.S. to enforce a patchwork of new stay-at-home orders, social-distancing directives and quarantines imposed in an effort to contain the march of the coronavirus.\\n\\nIn Maryland, authorities have charged at least two people in recent days with violating bans on public gatherings of more than 10 people – an offense that could result in a year in jail, a $5,000 fine, or both.\\n\\nIn Texas, Gov.

Pew Research shows that 93% of the world's population – that's 7.2 billion people – lives somewhere that has a restriction on people arriving from elsewhere who aren't citizens or residents. And about 3 billion people (39%) reside where countries have shuttered borders completely to noncitizens and nonresidents.\\n\\nIn the U.S., all foreign nationals from China, Iran and certain European countries are barred from entering.

Cuomo discussed the illness on his show \"Cuomo Prime Time,\" broadcast Wednesday night from isolation in his basement. The 49-year-old brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a tweet Tuesday that he tested positive after being exposed to people who are infected.\\n\\n\"This virus came at me, I’ve never seen anything like it,\" Cuomo said Wednesday, adding that he had a fever of more than 103 \"that would not quit.

       "Sacramento area church says it has been unfairly blamed in the spread as health officials link a third of cases to places of worship\\n\\nA California megachurch has found itself at the center of a coronavirus outbreak after public health officials connected it to 71 cases , even as church leaders say they have been unfairly blamed for failing to take action to stop the spread among church members.\\n\\nCounty health officials have put Bethany Slavic Missionary church, a Pentecostal house of worship in a suburb of Sacramento, at the heart of one of the largest outbreak clusters in the country. The church is reported to be the largest Slavic congregation in the US, with 3,500 members and a total attendance at some services of up to 10,000.\\n\\nThe county’s public health director said that a third of all coronavirus cases in Sacramento county have been linked to places of worship. As of Thursday, health officials tallied the number of county cases at 350, with 10 deaths.\\n\\nFlorida megachurch pastor arrested for breaching Covid-19 health order Read more\\n\\nSeventy-one of the members who tested positive live in Sacramento county, and members who live in other counties may also be infected. One parishioner has died, officials said, and a pastor indicated in an online sermon the church’s senior pastor has been hospitalized and two others are critically ill.\\n\\nHealth officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the Sacramento county public health director, Peter Beilenson, told the Los Angeles Times it is “outrageous this is happening”, adding that public health guidelines trump the freedom of religious expression.\\n\\nBeilenson said Thursday that in-person services at the Slavic megachurch have now ceased.\\n\\nBut he said church leaders rebuffed previous attempts to discuss the cases. “They’ve basically told us to leave them alone,” Beilenson told the Sacramento Bee. “This is extremely irresponsible and dangerous for the community.”\\n\\nChurch leaders did not immediately respond to phone calls from the Guardian, but a pre-recorded voicemail greeting said that most church services have been moved online.\\n\\nPlaces of worship across the county have in recent weeks found themselves in the spotlight after resisting or being slow to enforce social distancing norms. Hugs, handshakes, or passing a common donation basket can easily pass the virus from one person to the next.\\n\\nFaith Presbyterian church, also in Sacramento, has had two parishioners die from the virus and a total of five people test positive for the virus, the Sacramento Bee reported.\\n\\nForty minutes south, in Lodi, church leaders sent the city a “cease and desist” letter after police entered the church during a service on 25 March, telling authorities the church “intends to continue to meet this Sunday and all future Wednesdays and Sundays”.\\n\\nLeaders from Bethany Slavic Missionary church did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a press release published by the church contests information released by county health officials and media outlets.\\n\\nThe release states that a church leader said in a 14 March video address that the church “will comply with all regulations and guidance from the CDC. It also challenges the number of cases that have been linked to the church and said it was never informed any of its members had died.\\n\\n“It has been reported that 71 members of this church had fallen ill. These reports are believed to be inaccurate and falsely place the emphasis on this church,” the release says.\\n\\nIt adds that the county’s total number of cases linked to places of worship “has been falsely linked to Bethany Slavic Missionary Church. Media repetition of such unfounded representations invite ridicule, hatred, and violence against our church community.”\\n\\nIn an interview with a local ABC affiliate, Beilenson said the county released the name of the church out of concern for public safety.\\n\\n“The reason that we’re disclosing this is not to cause pariahs or cast aspersions at anybody, but to really hammer home the importance of congregating, not only in church, but also in prayer meetings in people’s homes,” said Beilenson.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Sacramento county health department released additional information in response to the church’s press release, confirming the numbers it had reported and saying the county coroner only informs family of the deceased as to cause of death.\\n\\n“While we know that the church as a whole has ceased to meet and the leadership is hosting online services, we have been told by multiple sources that there are groups that continue to meet in homes, despite the public health order to not gather with anyone outside of household members. These gatherings have been directly linked to the clusters of cases in the community,” the health department said.\\n\\n“In no way does Sacramento county condone ridicule, hatred or violence toward this church, any other church, or any member of society.”

       "The state has moved to stop tenants losing their homes during the coronavirus crisis but fears persist about what happens after\\n\\nAuthorities in Minnesota have pressed charges against a landlord who evicted a tenant during the coronavirus crisis and thus violated a state order forbidding kicking people out of their homes as the pandemic spreads across the US.\\n\\nThe move is one of the strongest actions yet taken to guard vulnerable people against the threat of eviction as unemployment in the US soars to levels not seen since the Great Recession in the wake of the economic crisis caused by the virus as widespread shutdowns cover the US.\\n\\n'This is about survival': California tenants plan rent strikes as Covid-19 relief falls short Read more\\n\\nNumerous cities and states have deployed eviction moratoriums. Among them is Minnesota, one of 15 states and territories to suspend both the enforcement of evictions and the filing of them in court, according to a tracker on new eviction policies being maintained by a professor at Columbia University.\\n\\nMinnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, worked with Governor Tim Walz to craft the state’s executive order suspending evictions. Landlords have so far been supportive, including the state’s biggest landlord advocacy group, the Minnesota Multi Housing Association.\\n\\nBut last week, in a case that was one of the first of its kind across the country, Ellison’s office pressed charges against a small landlord, Howard Mostad of rural Pine county, for violating the executive order against evictions.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint filed in court, Mostad had advised his tenants, a family of three with a four-year-old daughter, that their lease was ending on 1 April, but as the date approached, they had trouble finding a new place because of the coronavirus pandemic and the state’s “stay-at-home” order.\\n\\nMostad then allegedly showed up at their door on 2 April, and asked to be let in so he could show the property to a potential buyer. The family refused, saying they feared letting new people into their home, as their daughter has a pre-existing medical condition making her more vulnerable to the virus. Mostad responded by forcing his way in and then removing circuit breakers in the boiler room, leaving the family without electricity, heat or hot water, the complaint says.\\n\\nEllison said that while he understood many landlords were in a difficult situation, he thought Mostad’s actions were “particularly heartless” and he hoped the state would be sending a message by pressing charges. He said that forcing people into homeless shelters would increase the risk for public health.\\n\\n“We want to encourage small business people, including landlords, to seek help when they need it. But understand that by putting people out into the street, what they’re doing is not only hurting a family, but they’re actually exposing all of us to potential transmission,” Ellison told the Guardian.\\n\\nWhen reached by the Guardian, Mostad, 77, said that the family was not behind on rent, but that he had been planning to sell his farm, including the home where they lived, as business had been tough for several years.\\n\\nIn an interview, he lashed out against undocumented immigrants, refugees and Black Lives Matter activists, and what he sees as government overreach in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n“What’s happening with the coronavirus shutdown is a communist takeover,” he said.\\n\\nMostad now faces up to $25,000 in fines. Ellison said while his office would continue to enforce the eviction moratorium, he worries about what will happen when the order is lifted, and called for action at the federal level.\\n\\n“We’re going to need a way to figure out how to deal with the rent that eventually will come due for people who have been out of work through no fault of their own. We need a societal response to that, we need a national response to that,” he said.\\n\\nEllison’s fear is shared by Alieza Durana, a writer with the Eviction Lab, a team of researchers and students at Princeton University dedicated to mapping and understanding eviction causes and trends across the country.\\n\\nShe described a patchwork of different approaches across the country.\\n\\nShe noted that California had attempted to address the problem Ellison described by creating a six-month window in which tenants will be able to pay back rent. However, like several other states, California’s eviction moratorium also allows for “local discretion”, meaning cities in different parts of the state could interpret it differently. That, she said, could potentially leave residents in suburban and rural areas without strong tenant-rights organizations more vulnerable.\\n\\nEvictions continue meanwhile, in states such as Alabama and Oklahoma, where 1,156 evictions have been filed since 15 March, according to Open Justice Oklahoma.\\n\\n“The legal advocates that I’ve been speaking to have become very concerned that if we do not close these loopholes, the court system is going to receive an onslaught of eviction notices once the state of emergency is lifted,” she said.\\n\\nDurana cited a survey published by the Federal Reserve last year indicating four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering an unexpected $400 expense.\\n\\n“So given that that was true prior to the pandemic, there’s a very real possibility that moving forward, without government intervention, we could see the return of greater numbers of homelessness across the United States, and other types of hardship,” she said.

       "Angela Merkel hat an die Bürger appelliert, sich auch an Ostern an die Corona-Maßnahmen zu halten. Die aktuellen Zahlen würden Hoffnung machen, dennoch müsse man konsequent bleiben. Einige Dinge müssten so lange gelten, „bis es einen Impfstoff gibt“.\\n\\nAnzeige\\n\\nBundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) machen die aktuellen Zahlen zur Corona-Ausbreitung „vorsichtige Hoffnung“. „Ich will nicht verhehlen, dass ich vor gar nicht allzu langer Zeit noch besorgt war, ob wir unsere Maßnahmen noch verschärfen müssen“, sagte Merkel am Donnerstag im Kanzleramt in Berlin. Das sei derzeit aber nicht notwendig. „Der Anstieg flacht sich leicht ab.“\\n\\n„Wir dürfen jetzt nicht leichtsinnig sein“, betonte Merkel nichtsdestotrotz. „Ich kenne das auch von mir selber. Man hat ein bisschen Hoffnung, dann gewinnt man Zutrauen, dann ist man innerlich entspannter, und schon ist man ein bisschen leichtsinnig.“\\n\\nSie appellierte an die Bürger, sich weiter an die beschlossenen Maßnahmen zum Social Distancing zu halten. Einschränkungen würde es „noch längere Zeit“ geben. Es gelte unverändert, die Menschen zu schützen, für die das Coronavirus eine tödliche Gefahr sein könnte.\\n\\nLesen Sie auch Corona-Infektion Das sollten Schwangere jetzt wissen\\n\\nAnzeige\\n\\nVorsichtig sprach Merkel auch eine mögliche Lockerung von Maßnahmen an. „Wir wollen ja wieder zu unserem normalen Leben eines Tages zurückkehren“, so Merkel. Man müsse daher „in Spannen von ein bis zwei Wochen immer wieder gucken“, welche Änderungen möglich seien. Eine sehr wichtige Einschätzung dazu werde eine Studie von Wissenschaftlern der Leopoldina sein, die am Montag oder Dienstag veröffentlicht werde.\\n\\nLesen Sie auch Schwere Corona-Verläufe „Junge Männer, bei denen man das niemals erwarten würde“\\n\\nSchon jetzt sei allerdings klar: Einige Maßgaben, wie zum Beispiel das Abstandhalten und der Verzicht auf Händeschütteln, müssten so lange gelten, bis es einen Impfstoff gegen das Coronavirus gibt. Merkel schwor die Menschen auf ein „Leben mit dem Virus“ ein. „Auch wenn die Zahlen mal einen Tag besser werden, sie (die Pandemie) wird nicht verschwinden, bis wir wirklich einen Impfstoff haben, mit dem wir die Bevölkerung immunisieren können.“ Und weiter: „Ich wäre gerne, wirklich mit Freude und die Erste, die Ihnen sagen würde, es ist alles, wie es war, und wir könnten wieder loslegen, aber so ist es halt nicht.“\\n\\nGesundheitsminister Spahn erwägt Lockerungen nach Ostern\\n\\nEs gebe einen „Hoffnungsschimmer“, hatte Merkel am Donnerstag nach Angaben von Teilnehmern auch in einer Videokonferenz der Bundestagsfraktion von CDU und CSU gesagt. Es sei bisher ganz gut gelungen, das Gesundheitssystem nicht zu überlasten, wurde die Kanzlerin zitiert. Es dauere mittlerweile zum Beispiel länger, bis sich die Zahl der Infizierten verdopple.\\n\\nAnzeige\\n\\nBundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) hält erste Lockerungen der strengen Corona-Schutzmaßnahmen nach den Osterferien für möglich. Über einen schrittweisen Abbau von Auflagen könne aber nur dann geredet werden, wenn die bisherigen Einschränkungen über die Feiertage eingehalten würden, sagte er am Donnerstag in Berlin. Am Karfreitag treten verschärfte Bestimmungen für die Einreise nach Deutschland in Kraft, bei deren Missachtung hohe Geldbußen drohen.\\n\\nLesen Sie auch Maßnahmen zur Kontaktsperre So plant Brüssel den Corona-Exit für Deutschland\\n\\nBei fast 110.000 Infizierten in Deutschland gebe es mittlerweile mehr als 50.000 Gesundete, sagte Spahn. „Die Zahl der neu gemeldeten Infektionen flacht sich ab“, fügte er hinzu. Es gebe eher eine lineare Steigerung bei den Neuinfektionen. Zudem seien in Deutschland über 10.000 Intensivbetten frei.\\n\\nMerkel hofft auf Einigung der Euro-Länder\\n\\nMerkel setzt auf eine Einigung in der Gruppe der Euro-Länder auf Milliardenhilfen unter anderem für Italien und Spanien noch im Laufe des Tages. Merkel verwies auf die diskutierten Hilfen über den Europäischen Stabilisierungsmechanismus (ESM), die Europäische Investitionsbank (EIB) und über einen europäischen Fonds für Kurzarbeitergeld. Das zusammen summiere sich auf „ziemlich viele Milliarden“, und sie hoffe, „dass sie heute beschlossen werden können“.

       "Healthcare workers and first responders are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, risking their lives to keep communities safe. To help these hardworking professionals, Airbnb wants to provide free housing for 100,000 COVID-19 responders around the world.\\n\\nThe company announced the initiative yesterday, and as of this morning, more than 20,000 hosts have already offered up their homes, according to a Tweet from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. The goal is to provide medical and relief workers a safe, clean place to stay that allows them to be close to their patients while remaining safely isolated from their families.\\n\\nImage zoom An Airbnb listing in France. Courtesy of Airbnb\\n\\n\"Medical workers and first responders are providing lifesaving support during the coronavirus outbreak and we want to help,\" Airbnb's co-founder Joe Gebbia said in a statement. \"We've heard from countless hosts around the world who want to provide a comforting home to heroic first responders. We are connecting our nonprofit partners, government agencies, and others with our incredible host community to work together in these extraordinary times.\"\\n\\nMedical workers and first responders are providing lifesaving support during the coronavirus outbreak and we want to help. - Joe Gebbia\\n\\nRelated: Starbucks Pledges Free Coffees to 'Front-Line Responders' Helping In Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\nThe initiative began with pilot programs in France and Italy and has since expanded across the globe. Airbnb's partners, including the International Rescue Committee, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and International Medical Corps, and other organizations can now use the platform to find housing support for COVID-19 responders in need.\\n\\nWant to join the cause? Hosts can opt into the program and offer their spaces for free through Airbnb's Open Homes platform, which provides temporary emergency housing at no charge. If a host is unable to list their home for free, Airbnb will waive all fees on stays arranged through this initiative.\\n\\nTo protect the health and safety of homeowners and COVID-19 responders, Airbnb requires hosts to commit to increased safety precautions, including extra cleanings, 72-hour breaks between stays, and safe social distancing practices. Only listings that include the entire home with no other residents (no one-room rentals) qualify for this initiative.\\n\\nTo lend your support, you can offer your Airbnb listing for frontline workers or make a donation to Airbnb's partner organizations at airbnb.com/covid19relief. For another way to help, consider sewing medical masks to donate to hospitals and medical offices (you can even get pre-cut kits for free). Healthcare workers and first responders have a difficult task ahead, but safe shelter can make their jobs a little bit easier.
